<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The collection of old metal may at first sight appear
a somewhat unattractive hobby; a moment's reflection,
however, brings to mind the wonderful art
treasures of metal in our museums, gathered together
from many parts of the world; not necessarily of
the precious metals, for many of the most cunningly
contrived objects of antiquarian research are of
copper in one or more of its numerous forms of
alloy.</p>

<p>Copper is the basis of so many alloys of which
metallic curios are formed, that in its combination
with other metals it gives the collector an almost
inexhaustible field of research. It was the metal
of the ancients, which in combination with tin gave
them that useful metal with which to fashion
weapons of offence and defence, and later, as the
Bronze Age advanced, utilitarian objects of household
economy.</p>

<p>Collectors find the Age of Metals unfolding as
they arrange their collections with orderly sequence,
and thereby trace the progress of artificers throughout
the periods which have intervened since the
first bronze celt was moulded to the present day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Although this is the Age of Iron and the numerous
materials which metallurgical research and scientific
skill have produced, copper, and brass in its varied
forms, are still prominent, and the almost inexhaustible
supply of copper with which Nature has provided
us is still being drawn from.</p>

<p>In this work the curios and artistic objects of
use and ornament which have come down to us,
contributed by craftsmen of many ages and of many
countries, are passed in review. The object of so
doing has been to awaken still greater interest&mdash;if
that is possible&mdash;in the collection of copper and
brass, and to preserve to futurity metal objects from
which the utilitarian purpose of their manufacture is
fast waning&mdash;if not already gone.</p>

<p>Although the rarest and most costly objects are
to be found in museums and the galleries of the
wealthy, there are many still in the homes of the
people, and there are many who seek and obtain
pleasure and delight from the collection of the
curious and the beautiful who cannot afford the
unique specimens which are so costly. To such this
book should appeal, for the descriptions and the
illustrations have been drawn from many sources,
and their selection has by no means been confined
to the rarer types.</p>

<p>The illustrations are reproductions of photographs
which have been willingly furnished by owners of collections
and museum authorities. A large number,
too, have been specially drawn for this work by my
daughter, Miss Ethel Burgess.</p>

<p>I gratefully acknowledge the kindness of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
who have allowed me to make use of objects in
their collections. I would especially bear testimony
to the courtesy of the Directors of the British
Museum who have authorized their printers, The
University Press, Oxford, to furnish blocks of
some of the most interesting metal objects in the
Galleries. The Director of the Victoria and Albert
Museum has granted facilities for the reproduction
of some of the beautiful metal-work at South
Kensington.</p>

<p>My thanks are especially due to Mr. Guy Laking,
M.V.O., F.S.A., who, although in the midst of the
removal of the London Museum from Kensington
Palace to its new home at Stafford House, has
kindly supplied several photographs of scarce metal
objects. Special drawings have been made of several
representative objects in the Guildhall Museum,
through the courtesy of the Curator.</p>

<p>Permission has been granted to reproduce photographs
and illustrations of objects in several of the
more important provincial Museums, and in several
instances some very interesting information has been
given by the Curators. Among others I should
like to give the names of Mr. F. R. Rowley, Curator
of the Royal Albert Memorial Museum at Exeter;
Mr. T. Sheppard, F.G.S., F.S.A.Scot., Curator of
the Municipal Museum, Hull; Dr. Hoyle, Director
of the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff; Mr.
J. A. Charlton Deas, F.R.Hist.S., Director of the
Museum and Art Gallery, Sunderland; Mr. Thos.
Midgley, F.R.Met.S., Chadwick Museum, Bolton;
Mr. R. Rathbun, Assistant Secretary of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
States National Museum, Washington; and the Town
Clerk of Winchester.</p>

<p>I am further indebted to Messrs. Glendining &amp; Co.,
Ltd., who have given me permission to reproduce
some beautiful Oriental metal-work which has
recently passed under the hammer in their London
Galleries; also to Messrs. Herbert Benham &amp; Co., for
a drawing of the copper ball and cross of St. Paul's;
and to Mr. Amor, of St. James's, S.W., The Edward
Gallery, of King Street, S.W., and Mr. Chas. Wayte,
of Edenbridge, who have given me photographs of
rare pieces of art metal-work.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to refrain from technicalities
or dry descriptions; but some of the chapters have
necessarily a touch of the workshop and the foundry
about them. I can assure my readers, however,
that the "metallic ring" is inseparable from copper
and brass, and that the pleasures of possession will
be added to by the better understanding it will
impart to those who collect and admire similar
objects to those referred to in this work.</p>

<h2><a name="GLOSSARY" id="GLOSSARY"></a>GLOSSARY</h2>


<p><b>Astrolabe.</b>&mdash;The astrolabe is an instrument which
was largely used in taking the altitude of the sun or
stars at sea. It was well known to the Greeks, and
takes its names from two Greek words, meaning
<em>a star</em> and <em>to take</em>. Perfected by the Arabs, the
instrument was introduced into Europe about the
tenth century. It is said that the most famous
examples are to be seen in the museums at Madrid
and Florence. There is one in the British Museum,
which was made for Henry, Prince of Wales, in
1574.</p>

<p><b>Barrow.</b>&mdash;Mounds in which bronze celts, knives,
spear-heads, and food receptacles are found along
with the remains of chieftains and others of the
prehistoric peoples once inhabiting this country.
The term "barrow" originally denoted a "little
hill." Round barrows are the most common form,
although some are oval and some of the "long
barrow" type. The methods of burial differed, but
in most instances implements of stone or bronze
as well as vessels of pottery and some trinkets
belonging to the dead were usually placed near
to the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Betel-Nut Boxes.</b>&mdash;The beautifully ornate boxes,
chiefly found in India, made for holding the betel-nut
and the shell lime used by the natives who chew
the leaves and nut of the areca palm.</p>

<p><b>Bidri Metal.</b>&mdash;The metal objects known as bidri are
made of an alloy of copper-zinc and lead, damascened
with silver, showing a peculiarly striking contrast in
black and white. The villages round Lucknow are
famous for this curious and effective inlaid metal work.</p>

<p><b>Brass.</b>&mdash;An alloy of copper and zinc. Early brass
was copper mixed with calamine melted in a crucible.
The ancient form of alloyed metal employed by the
Romans was copper and tin, which, although frequently
termed "brass" is more correctly defined
as bronze (see <a href="#Bronze">Bronze</a>). The greater the proportion
of zinc the lighter the colour; but the addition of an
extra quantity of zinc reduced the tenacity and
ductility of the metal.</p>

<p><b>Brasses.</b>&mdash;The term brasses is applied (in antiquarian
and curio metallurgy) to the monumental
brasses which as early as the first half of the
thirteenth century replaced the older effigies, such
as those of the Crusaders, which may be seen in the
Temple Church, in London. The brasses, of which
many rubbings have been taken, include the large
brasses, covering nearly the whole of their tomb
flag, and the small brasses on which were engraved
emblems, escutcheons, and inscriptions, inset into
large slabs of marble or stone, ornamenting rather
than constituting the covering of tombs.</p>

<p><b>Brazier.</b>&mdash;Primarily a pan for holding burning coals.
The brazier was in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a domestic appliance for keeping hot dishes
for the table, some very interesting examples of an
ornamental character, doubtless used for that purpose,
being referred to in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>. The brazier, so
called to-day, is a tripod open fire chiefly used out of
doors in some open space.</p>

<p><a id="Bronze"></a><b>Bronze.</b>&mdash;The bronze of the ancients consisted
chiefly of pure copper and an alloy of tin. In those
very early days the compounding and mixing of the
metals must have been done largely by experience
and "rule of thumb." It was before the days of
metallurgical research and before the chemistry
of metals was understood. As yet there was no
formula. Curiously enough the proper nomenclature
of metals has never been formulated, and
"bronze" is the term still applied in a very
haphazard way to various alloys.</p>

<p>Quite recently a very able lecture was delivered
by Dr. Rosenhain, of the National Physical Laboratory,
on the "Nomenclature of Alloys" at a meeting
of the Birmingham Section of the Institute of Metals.
Every one, he told us, described metals "at his own
sweet will," and for the most part by misleading
terms. He suggested in reference to copper-bronze
alloys that "copper-zinc" might denote an alloy with
more copper than zinc in it, and "zinc-copper" when
the former metal was present in a greater degree.
He thought "tin-copper" would serve as a fairly
wide definition of modern bronze. In such bronzes
aluminium is now generally added. Other scientists
have suggested the definition of bronze by chemical
numerals, thereby indicating their contents with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
more exactitude. At present, however, the term
bronze is very elastic.</p>

<p><b>Buckler.</b>&mdash;The old English name <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bocler</i> denoted a
shield with a boss. It was worn on the left arm;
used in the Middle Ages to parry blows rather than
intended to act as a cover for the body like the larger
and more cumbrous shields.</p>

<p><b>Chattie or Chatty.</b>&mdash;A porous earthenware vessel
used in India for cooling water and other purposes.</p>

<p><b>Chaufferette.</b>&mdash;A spherical metal vessel in the
interior of which was a small chain, from which
was suspended a cup in which could be placed a
piece of red-hot metal or charcoal. It was usually
a hand-warmer; some chaufferettes, however, were
larger, almost like small stoves. The name is derived
from a table stove or small furnace, literally a cylindrical
box of sheet-iron, the word coming from the
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chauffer</i>, to heat.</p>

<p><b>Circe-Perdu Process.</b>&mdash;The Japanese have been
wonderfully clever in their manipulation of metals,
especially considering the very primitive appliances
they used in the early days. Some of their most
remarkably intricate bronzes were fashioned and
modelled in wax, delicately tooled, hardened a little,
and then covered over with layers of fine clay until
the mould became strong enough. The clay mould
when dried was heated until the wax ran out, leaving
a smooth and beautifully finished mould in which the
bronze metal could be poured, the clay being broken
away when it was cold. Great skill and at the same
time much patience were needed to produce such
charming effects. The bronzes of old Japan were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
frequently inlaid with fine and delicate tracery in silver
and gold. Up to comparatively recent times beautifully
modelled ornaments were fashioned by such
laborious processes, and even now by more modern
methods much labour is expended on their production.</p>

<p><b>Counters.</b>&mdash;Counters have been used in card games
from quite early times. They were frequently of
engraved metal. In the reign of James I., we are
told by Horace Walpole, one Nicholas Hilliard was
licensed for twelve years to engrave card counters on
which was the Royal portrait. In later reigns similar
counters were so engraved. Those of the time of
Queen Anne bore a great resemblance to the obverse
of the then current coins. Sets of counters were
frequently supplied in metal boxes, the exteriors of
which were often decorated by engravings. It should
be clearly understood that metal card-counters&mdash;old
and modern&mdash;are quite distinct from commercial
counters or jettons.</p>

<p><b>Couvre de Feu.</b>&mdash;The French term, literally, cover of
the fire, became the name of the metal shield or cover
with which the fire was shut down in the days of the
Norman kings. From the same root term the
English curfew is derived. It was the curfew bell
that sounded the signal for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couvre de feu</i> to
be brought out and lights and fires to be extinguished.
These metal plates, so frequently
engraved all over, are among the rarities of domestic
curios (see <a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>).</p>

<p><b>Damascene.</b>&mdash;The process of inlaying steel or other
metal work with silver or gold beaten into the incised
metal. To damascene (also spelled damasken) was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a process first emanating from Damascus&mdash;hence its
name.</p>

<p><b>Dialling.</b>&mdash;A dial plate is made by fixing to a flat
surface a stile or gnomon, which forms with the
horizon an angle equal to the latitude of the place
in which it is to be used. When the gnomon is in
position a line is drawn upon the surface of the plate
so that the shadow of the stile falls exactly upon it
at noonday, the plane through the stile and the sun
coinciding with the meridian. It cannot be too
clearly understood by users of old sundials that dial
plates used in any other latitude than that for which
they were constructed must necessarily be inaccurate.</p>

<p><b>Ember Tongs.</b>&mdash;These little tongs were formerly
used to take up the hot embers from among the
ashes of a dying fire. They were constantly in use
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, many
being decorative, the handles often being fashioned
to serve the purpose of a pipe stopper.</p>

<p><b>Enamels.</b>&mdash;The enamels applied to copper or brass
are glass coloured with oxides of metals, producing
blue, green, violet, red, and other shades. These
when fused adhere to the metal surface and are
very lasting. Various processes have been adopted,
especially in the fine arts. The principal older
processes are champlev√©, cloisonn√©, and Limoges.
In the first named the spaces to be filled in with
enamels are cut into the metal foundation; then,
when the enamels have been fired, they are rubbed
down and polished. The cloisonn√© process, chiefly
practised in the East, consists of small cells or
cloisons formed of wire filled with the requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
colours. Limoges enamels, the finest period of
which is placed in the sixteenth century, were
formed by a ground of enamel painted over, chiefly
with classical subjects.</p>

<p>Opaque enamels on, usually, a convex copper disc
or plate, were the work of later craftsmen. At
Battersea and Bilston in England, towards the close
of the eighteenth century, many small boxes and
trinkets (see <a href="#Page_356">p. 356</a>) were produced. The enamels
of recent date applied to utilitarian objects and
cooking vessels are seldom fixed upon a ground-work
of copper&mdash;iron or steel being the usual base. In
jewelry and small trinkets enamelling on copper is still
practised, many such objects being of Oriental origin.</p>

<p><b>Fibula.</b>&mdash;A small brooch or buckle. Many of the
beautifully fashioned fibul√¶ have been found among
the remains of Roman London, a large number
being on view in the Guildhall Museum.</p>

<p><b>Gipciere.</b>&mdash;A kind of pouch formerly worn at the
girdle, an early type of purse. The name is sometimes
spelled <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gipser</i>.</p>

<p><b>Hookah.</b>&mdash;The name given to the bottle through
which tobacco smoke is passed. In smoking with
a hookah the smoke is cooled by being made to
pass through water.</p>

<p><b>Latten.</b>&mdash;The name is primarily derived from the
nature of the material&mdash;thin sheets. The brass or
latten brass was formerly used chiefly for making
church utensils. Black latten consists of milled
sheets of brass, composed of copper and zinc; roll
latten, of metal polished on both sides; and white
latten of brass and tin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Meander.</b>&mdash;A term applied to the decorations on
Japanese and other bronzes. To wind, to twist,
meandering like the winding river Maeander, in
Phrygia, from which the proverbial term is derived.</p>

<p><b>Mirrors of Bronze.</b>&mdash;The bronze mirrors of the
Romans were given their reflective power by using
an alloy of antimony and lead, a combined metal
which took a highly reflective polish; the backs,
handles, and frames were of bronze.</p>

<p><b>Mortars.</b>&mdash;Mortars such as those referred to on
p. 226 with accompanying pestles, were commonly
in domestic use from the sixteenth to the eighteenth
centuries. In later years they were employed chiefly
in the preparation of drugs, but more recently they
have been superseded by the modern way of preparing
spices and other compounds by machinery.
The form of the vessel may be described as an
inverted bell, the substances therein being pounded
or rubbed with the pestle.</p>

<p><b>Patina.</b>&mdash;A term expressive of the colour or encrustation
which is imparted to works of art by age.
It is used chiefly in reference to the beautiful green
formation which covers ancient bronzes, shading
from light green to deep brown. This crustation
consists of basic copper carbonate, the result of
exposure to the air. It is chiefly found on bronzes,
the alloy of which is mostly of tin and very little
zinc. The patina or patine is also the name given
by the Romans to a shallow basin used for
domestic purposes.</p>

<p><b>Pilgrims' Signs.</b>&mdash;The symbols or signs worn by
pilgrims when visiting one or other of the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
shrines in this country in medi√¶val days were
distinct from the crests or badges of wealthy patrons
which were at one time worn pretty generally as
indicating on whose service the journey they were
making was being performed. Pilgrims' signs were
worn on the outward journey chiefly as protective
amulets; on the return journey mostly as proof of
the pilgrimage, such signs being purchased at or
near the shrines to which homage had been paid.
The chief shrines in this country were those of
St. Thomas √† Becket at Canterbury, and Walsingham
Priory in Norfolk, where Our Lady of Walsingham
was held in high repute.</p>

<p><b>Weather-Vane.</b>&mdash;The vane denotes any flat surface
attached to an axis and moved by the wind, usually
applied to some elevated object for the purpose of
telling which way the wind blows. A strip of metal
cut to some fanciful form and placed upon a
perpendicular axis around which it moves easily.</p>

<p>The coppersmith has taken a prominent place
among the craftsmen of all nations, and at all
periods, and in not a few instances he has been
acknowledged as an artist of no mean order. The
material upon which he has worked has been copper
and its alloys and compounds. From this metal
have been produced many valuable antiques, and
among the work of the coppersmith of more recent
days there are objects of intense interest and of
great beauty. In this work many collectable objects
have been classified, and in the different groups of
metal-work referred to attention is drawn to these
beautiful and sometimes quaint reminders of past
generations, and also to some of the most notable
non-collectable metal-work which may be seen and
admired in museums and art galleries, and to a few
of the copper monuments, memorials, and historic
relics which are gazed at by the curious, oftentimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
without thought of the materials of which they are
composed.</p>


<h3>Ancient Bronze.</h3>

<p>The raw material, copper, smelted and beaten or
poured from a crucible into moulds, was in more
ancient times used in its unalloyed purity&mdash;and it
is still used in that state. It was, however, soon
discovered that copper might be improved for many
purposes by mixing with it other metals possessing
different properties. The prehistoric peoples who
lived in Britain, and in other countries within reach,
soon added tin, which was found in Cornwall quite
near to the surface, and was from early times sold
to Ph&oelig;nician traders, thereby producing bronze.
It is of this metal that most of the much valued
curios of the so-called Bronze Age are made.
Those who fashioned them were clever manipulators
of the alloyed metal, and by processes now little
understood were able to temper tools and weapons
and to give them keen-cutting edges. Our museums
are full of spear-heads, celts, axes, and palstaves
of bronze, which were cast in moulds of stone cut
to the required shapes by those primitive workers in
metal, who used simple crucibles in which it was
melted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>

<p>The prehistoric bronzes, some examples of which
are referred to in another chapter, are the earliest
collectable curios formed of metal. They include
implements of war and of the chase and some
domestic utensils and cooking vessels. To these
useful objects must be added ornaments and trinkets
of bronze, so many of which have been found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
barrows and burying-places of prehistoric races.</p>

<p>The knowledge of bronze appears to have been
widespread. It was understood by those who dwelt
in this country, by the inhabitants of European
countries, by Eastern nations, and by the Egyptians,
who left such wonderful monuments behind them,
giving evidence that they knew how to impart a
knife-like edge to their tools of bronze.</p>


<h3>Bronzes of Greece and Rome and Eastern Nations.</h3>

<p>The ancient bronze of prehistoric days must not
be confused with the metals or compounds of copper
and its alloys which enabled the Greeks to produce
such wonderful statues. They learned to impart
hardness to copper, and wrought much delicate
handiwork, much of which has perished; but
enough has been spared to confirm classic history
and to enable us to realize something of their conceptions
of the old gods and personified hopes and
aspirations. In like manner the wonderful bronzes
of China and Old Japan were wrought; the metal-worker's
art in those countries goes back many
centuries. Some of the more delicately chiselled
figures and groups were first modelled in wax upon
an iron core, the mould being then formed of soft
clay. When the clay was baked the wax melted,
and running away through prepared outlets, left a
smooth cavity into which the bronze was afterwards
poured. When the metal was cold the clay would
easily be broken away, and the object, at the
moulding of which we often marvel, made perfect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
In course of time such bronzes have been coated
over with a beautiful patina of green, that natural
finish which age can alone impart. It is in that
state so many of the bronzes of Grecian sculptors are
found, and it is covered with patina of many delightful
shades that we buy the metallic curios from China
and Japan.</p>


<h3>Copper for Enamels.</h3>

<p>In the days when so many beautiful ecclesiastical
ornaments were fashioned, copper was the foundation
used by medi√¶val artists as the base of their exquisite
enamels. These beautiful objects are especially
referred to in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a>, where reference is
also made to the enamels of Eastern countries, in the
making of which brass was frequently used as the
foundation. Copper has been found suitable as
the groundwork upon which super-finishes have
given that superiority and attractiveness associated
with many of the fine arts. It was suitable for
gilding over and for decorating with precious stones.
Copper was also frequently used by painters, its
smooth surface being regarded as an excellent material
on which to work. As an example, some of the
religious pictures, especially miniatures, were painted
on copper, instead of on wood panels.</p>


<h3>The Brass of Commerce.</h3>

<p>Many speak of brass as a metal apart from copper,
yet the brass of commerce, worked up in many forms,
is only a composite metal of which copper is the
basis. The popularity of pure copper as the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
from which household utensils and many constructional
objects of use and ornament were made
in the past continued unabated until metallurgical
chemists discovered how, by using an alloy of zinc,
the metal we call brass could be cast, rolled, and
otherwise manipulated. Among the advantages
claimed for brass is that it has a harder surface and
is more resisting than copper. From the days of
Queen Elizabeth onward it was much favoured for
domestic vessels, and even at the present time it is
used to some extent; there has, however, always
been a concurrent use of copper.</p>


<h3>Bell Metal and Other Alloys.</h3>

<p>There is yet another important alloy, which from
its chief use takes the name of bell-metal; its companion
alloy is gun-metal. In the mixing of these
metals special alloys are aimed at according to the
object in view, that is to say, the ingredients vary,
but, broadly defined, the copper and its alloy tin used
in bell-metal are in the proportion of three to one.
The metal was in the past used for those much
employed articles of commercial and domestic use,
mortars, in addition to the founding of bells. Bell-metal
was also the material of which weights and
measures (especially the standards kept in many of
the old cities) were chiefly made (see illustrations
and references thereto in Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_X">X</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">XI</a>).</p>


<h3>The Sources from which Copper is Derived.</h3>

<p>Copper seems to have been very widely distributed
all over the world, a fact that has contributed to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
general use. At one time a local metal employed in
a pure state and in conjunction with alloys, chiefly
where it was mined, it is now brought to the metal-founder
from other parts of the world. Although
vast quantities of copper are now imported into
England, it was from British mines that the supply
was drawn in days gone by. The Britons understood
its use, no doubt finding it out by accident,
just as the natives of many other countries have
done. Copper, as evidenced by the marvellous
Benin bronzes, was known in Central Africa long
ago. The mines at Mansfield, in Germany, are the
oldest in Europe, and there workers have been
digging up copper for seven centuries.</p>

<p>The collector of old metal objects naturally takes the
greater interest in well authenticated specimens known
to have been fashioned in districts once famous for
their copper mines. Unfortunately, the Cornish mines
produce little ore now. When the Romans worked
them they obtained copper quite near to the surface;
but such easily mined ores have long been cleared.</p>

<p>Copper smelting was carried on in Cumberland
and Northumberland in days gone by. In the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries copper was smelted
in Yorkshire and Lancashire. Then we read of the
reopening of old Cornish mines and of furnaces
being erected in Bristol. The mines of Anglesea are
less known, although they were once very active.
South Wales has for many years past been closely
identified with copper smelting, and rolling mills were
established in Swansea as early as 1720; and
although the better knowledge of metallic chemistry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
enables manufacturers to produce copper more economically
than in days gone by, the old principle of
crushing, calcining, roasting, and washing the ore,
although improved by modern machinery, is still
adhered to.</p>

<p>As with many other industries, the invention of
the steam-engine was a boon to the owners of
copper mines in Cornwall, many being flooded
towards the end of the eighteenth century. With
the steam-engine to work them, pumps were put in
operation, mines were cleared, and for a time at any
rate ore was procured and renewed activity was
visible in many British centres. In those days many
of the things we now regard as curios were being
made. As with many other raw materials the value
of copper steadily advanced, for as trade and commerce
grew, immense quantities were used up for
sheathing ships' bottoms, roofing buildings, for
engravers' plates, and for the rolls used in the
printing of calicoes. Other sources of supply have
been found, for the chain extending from Land's
End to Dartmoor no longer serves. The famous
Parys Mines are no more, and it is from foreign
countries the supply comes. Some of our Colonies
have proved rich in ores, such, for instance, as South
Australia, where it is said an early settler examining
the burrow of a wombat found the green mineral,
that incident leading to the opening of mines
yielding vast quantities of copper ore.</p>


<h3>The Making of Brass.</h3>

<p>The brass of commerce, rolled in sheets, drawn in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
rods and wire, and cast in ingots ready for the
founder, is, as it has been stated, a composite metal,
very well suited to many purposes. During the sixteenth
century much progress was made in metal-founding.
The Worshipful Company of Founders
was busy. Many "battery" works were set up in
England, and there brass was hammered or battered
into shape. Thus brass-workers were engaged in
making useful pots and pans, now in their much
worn state eagerly sought after by the collector.
Some worked with the ladle and crucible, others
with the hammer and anvil or wood block.</p>

<p>The earlier brass was composed of copper mixed
with calamine melted in a crucible, a process which
continued until the more modern form of melting
metallic zinc with copper was understood. Champion's
process, by which this newer method was carried out,
was kept secret for some time, but about the middle
of the eighteenth century it was generally understood
and the process of stamping brass became a common
one in the Birmingham district.</p>


<h3>Copper as an Alloy.</h3>

<p>Copper, the base of so many alloys, has itself
been found a useful alloy of most workable metals,
not only in modern times but in years gone by. It
is one of the best hardening agents in aluminium, the
newer metal which is to some extent displacing
copper and brass cooking pots and much ornamental
metal-work. According to an expert, aluminium is
tasteless, and possesses all the advantages of copper
without its drawbacks. That being so, perhaps even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
vessels of brass, such as may still be seen in kitchens,
may soon become obsolete and pass shortly into the
r√¥le of the museum curio. Incidentally it may be
mentioned that aluminium is not altogether a new
metal, neither is its use confined to civilized countries,
where metallurgists have proved its advantages; for
the natives of the Philippines, Borneo, and other
islands in the Pacific have long used it as an independent
metal, and also for the purposes of ornamenting
other materials. Many of the copper and
brass curios brought into this country, the products
of native smiths, working far from civilized lands, are
partly made of aluminium, alloyed chiefly with
native copper. The natives of Borneo melt it in
fireclay crucibles over a coke fire, and are very
clever at producing some remarkably fine pieces of
metal-work, using different metals for the same
object; thus some of their daggers have brass hilts
and aluminium blades. The metal-worker has frequently
introduced aluminium in the decoration of
copper and brass gongs, some of the older examples
from Japan being extremely decorative.</p>


<h3>The Characteristics of the Metals.</h3>

<p>Some collectors very wisely follow up their
researches after new treasures by investigating the
methods of their production, and they even visit
modern works where similar methods, although more
advanced, are going on. Very interesting indeed
is it to watch the molten metal as it is mixed
and poured into moulds and made into pigs. To
see the great rolling mills through which the bars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
are passed, and to watch the hammering and
drawing by the steam-hammer and powerful
machinery, is an education which enhances the
interest there is in the possession of finished goods&mdash;old
and new.</p>

<p>It is said the brassfounder's requirements to-day
are much the same as they have always been, although
perhaps there are more iron moulds used and greater
care is taken in their preparation. The mould must
have a good surface and be composed of the right
kind of iron. The best metal for the purpose
appears to be one high in silica and low in combined
carbon, thus securing a soft iron which will not crack
when the molten metal strikes it. The science of
metals is constantly being added to, and the research
of chemists of recent years has done much towards
improving the skill of present-day artists, most of
whom, however, readily give praise to the almost
intuitive skill of the artists of olden time.</p>

<p>The fashioning of copper and brass follows the
preparation of the metal; there are many reasons
why copper and its compounds and alloys have
been so generally employed, one of the principal
being that the ductility of copper has made it
welcome wherever the hammer has been brought into
play. The possibility of hammering out brass and
copper, and especially the latter, is seen in the
extreme fineness to which copper wire can be drawn.
Hood uses the similitude when speaking of how
travel improves the mind, and tells of the gradual
narrowing of copper and brass as they become finer
and finer, likening those who have not travelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the narrowed metal. Collectors of curios show
characteristic traits, twofold in application. There
are some who get more broad-minded the farther they
travel, the more museums they inspect, and the wider
their knowledge of the antiquities they admire.
Others, specialists for the most part, get into very
narrow grooves, confining their hobbies to some one
class of goods, not always the most interesting in
public estimation; then they wonder how it is that
their hobbies are not appreciated by their friends!
Surely the greatest delight is in a representative collection,
such as the hobby under review, which shows
all the possibilities of copper and brass in their varied
treatment. In the examples which have come down
to us from the Ancients, in those schemes of decoration
which mark clearly the work of the artists of
some one country or period, and in those general
collectable objects which have been brought together
from everywhere, there is a liberal education:</p>

<p>The multiplicity of collectable objects needed to
supply collectors makes the uninitiated wonder where
all these antiques come from. Countless numbers of
beautiful objects have found their way into the melting-pot
in the past, and what once was old has in
some new form become once more a useful article,
in its turn to be discarded and perhaps melted up
and recast.</p>


<h3>In Buried Cities.</h3>

<p>The curios which have been preserved for centuries
beneath the soil are often of priceless value, telling of
the habits of peoples of whom history has told us
little. Celts, knives, spear-heads, and food receptacles
are discovered on the sites of prehistoric camping-grounds.
The delicately tooled bronzes from buried
cities like Pompeii and Herculaneum come to us with
almost a living force in this twentieth century. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
we gaze at the wonderful beauty of their forms and
the charming patina of green with which they are
covered, we can almost imagine what they looked
like in the hands of patrons of art in the far-off times
when they were first fashioned. Our own country is
full of ruins of ancient cities far below the present
roadways. When the Romans built Bath it was in
a hollow much deeper than the level of the modern
city, and it is in these lower levels that relics of
Roman Bath are found.</p>

<p>There is a ring of sadness in the desolation of such
ancient cities as Verulamium, Cirencester, Kenchester,
and similarly deserted locations where modern excavations
have been going on recently. It seems
curious how the very sites of such once famous places
have been lost, but not strange when we remember
that more recently occupied towns are but grass
mounds&mdash;to-day explorers are cutting into the turf-covered
mounds of Old Sarum to ascertain where its
chief buildings stood. The finds on these ancient
sites are varied; many of them are metallic, and
although of trifling intrinsic value are prized as
being authentic curios.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span></p>

<h3>Turned up by the Plough.</h3>

<p>The plough has played an important part in
history, and collectors owe much to that useful
implement. It has been the means of bringing to
light many vessels which have been buried for centuries,
for although land has been ploughed many
seasons, a deeper ploughshare or more frequent
ploughing on the same spot has brought nearer to
the surface a copper vessel or an earthen jar, full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
antiquarian interest. The field and the forest, and
even the deserted mines, have brought to collectors
of old metal many interesting relics. Until quite
recently there was an old bronze caldron on view in
the window of a dealer in antiques in Chester. It
was the prototype of many similar vessels that have
been made in later days in different parts of the
country, the model on which the more modern pots
or camp-kettles of the gipsies and the three-legged
pots commonly suspended over the cottage hearth,
until comparatively modern times, have been fashioned.
It is worthy of note that the principle adopted by
those early metal-workers is still observed in the more
scientific construction of cooking vessels to-day. The
form of the caldron was such that by applying heat
under the centre the flames spread and leapt up the
sides, curling as they travelled, following the lines
fashioned by the coppersmiths, and heating the contents
of the vessel equally. Such ancient caldrons,
sometimes much worn and at others in fairly good
condition, have been preserved by Mother Earth until
discovered in modern times.</p>


<h3>Among Saxon and Norman Remains.</h3>

<p>The Saxons and Normans used metal, and the
brawny arms of the smiths, and later the founders,
fashioned the cooking-pots made in their day. Many
metal curios, much battered by fallen masonry, have
been found among the ruins of Norman castles and in
some cases of the still earlier Saxon dwellings. The
discoveries of curios of those periods are by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
frequent, and it would appear as if we must now be
content with storing carefully those relics already
discovered. Modern restorations and excavations
have brought many valuable antiquities to light, and
authorities have been very careful to preserve them in
county or local museums.</p>


<h3>In Hidden Chambers.</h3>

<p>The splendour of medi√¶val days when feasting in
the great hall of the baron or overlord has been
revealed by many noted finds. The great kitchens
of those mansions were full of copper and brass, and
it is from such supplies that many of the best
authenticated specimens have come. Some are
historical; even bronze caldrons and more modest-looking
saucepans have been made to the order of
some medi√¶val chieftain or baron.</p>

<p>The life of the common people of this country
varied little between the days of the Norman Conquest
and those of the Tudor sovereigns who held
court in the houses of the nobility. The dress, costume,
and rough splendour of the Elizabethan age
had its effect, however, on the homes of courtiers and
eventually of the common people. When the stormy
times of the Civil War came there was a rude breaking
up of the old order of things, and in Cromwellian
days some preparation for the new which was to
come. After the battlefield came the destruction of
stronghold and mansion by order of the Parliament.
Some escaped, and within the last century not a few
domestic curios have been found during the restoration
and rebuilding of old houses dating from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
time of the Commonwealth. Priests' cells and secret
chambers, sliding panels and concealed cupboards,
and other hidden places were the rule rather than the
exception at the time of the Civil War. In some of
these long-forgotten places of concealment some
very interesting domestic objects in copper and
brass have been found during rebuilding and
restoration.</p>


<h3>In Local Museums.</h3>

<p>It is a moot point whether the frequent change in
the ownership of curios which goes on every day, as
evidenced by the auction sales, stirs up the curiosity
of the collector and awakens his interest in his hobby
to a greater extent than when such curios are placed
on view in local museums. The fact remains that,
notwithstanding the constant circulation of curios,
many find a permanent home in museums. Not only
do the national collections in the British Museum,
and the Victoria and Albert Museum at South Kensington
grow rapidly, but in almost every town of
note there are local and great district museums.
This latter class is instanced in the Welsh National
Museum at Cardiff. There are two typical local
museums in London&mdash;the Guildhall Museum and the
London Museum, which has just found a new home
at Stafford House. These museums stimulate local
collectors, but they do not contribute to their collections.
As places of reference they are invaluable, for
the wider spread knowledge of antiques secured by
the objects shown prevents amateurs from falling into
traps and consequently becoming disheartened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3>Dealers' Shops.</h3>

<p>The shops of dealers supplement the auction-rooms.
They are partly fed from them and partly by
the persistent search ever going on for objects in
which their owners have little interest and are willing
to part with for a consideration&mdash;not always the "top
price." The greater popularity of curio-hunting has
caused a vigorous search of attic and cellar at the
instance of dealers as well as collectors. Even the
palaces of kings and queens and the houses of
the nobility have been ransacked, and treasures from
an artistic point of view, as well as from a utilitarian,
have been brought to light and the dust of many
years wiped away.</p>

<p>Many delightful examples of the coppersmith's art
were until recently condemned by the travelling
tinker as being no longer repairable, with the natural
consequence that, their value as antiques being unknown,
they were eventually sold for an "old song."
Those pioneers of collecting who had time on their
hands and foresaw an accruing value of even old metal
went about from town to town examining the marine
stores and visiting villages and farmhouses in search
of anything old and curious. To-day there are few
genuine antiques without some one to value them.
Nearly every collection belongs to an appreciative
owner, and when curios change hands it is generally
at a premium instead of at "a bargain price."</p>

<p>Hitherto reference has been made chiefly to metal
curios of British make, and to those objects with
which Englishmen have become familiar. The
collector, however, is cosmopolitan in his aims, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
cheerfully searches the world over for objects of
interest. His curios come from the Far East, from
Central Africa, and from all parts of Europe, and to
some extent from the American continents. There
have been many methods of producing metal-work,
yet native workers in all countries have had but two
processes upon which they have based their plans,
and it is from the smiths who hammered copper and
brass into shape, and in later days stamped it, and
the founder who cast the metal in moulds, that all
our curios come.</p>


<h3>The Engraver's Art.</h3>

<p>This outline of the hunting-ground of the collector
would be incomplete without some mention of
the products of the graver's tool which has produced
so many works of art. The much prized mezzotints,
stipples, and line engravings are pictures for the most
part printed from copper plates. The metal rolled
in sheets and planished becomes a work of art in
itself when covered with those beautiful pictures so
cleverly wrought upon the metal by the light touch
of the graver.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting uses to which
copper has been put is that of executing beautiful
miniatures&mdash;tiny pictures, portraits, and emblematic
designs such as were used by traders on their
stationery in years gone by. The copper-plate
engraver has left his mark, too, in the beautifully
quaint and very valued early issues of postage-stamps,
some of which were printed from copper plates. Just
as copper plays an important part in the production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of postage-stamps and pictures, so copper in
conjunction with its alloys is the common metal
of currency. Some of the most valuable metallic
curios are the ancient coins which have been dug up
from where they have been buried for centuries, or
discovered in some hidden chamber. Such little
objects of copper or bronze have an antiquarian value
far beyond either their artistic beauty or their age
warrants being associated with them. Collectors of
metals know the value of some of the historic commemorative
medallions in bronze, and heroes and
warriors show their appreciation of one of the
commoner metals in the value they set upon the
simple Maltese cross inscribed "For Valour," for
the Victoria Cross is more coveted than any naval or
military award the Sovereign of these realms can
bestow. Its owners regard it as a precious relic, and
the reluctance of those left behind to part with it is
seen in the large sum which has to be paid for one of
these simple bronze crosses when it comes in the
market.</p>

useful bronzes, the prototypes of later brasses&mdash;The forger at work.</p>


<p>As it has already been intimated, our older metal
curios come to us from the Bronze Age. In the relics
of that period, in which the British Museum is so
rich, we are able to mark the great difference that
must have existed between the people who lived the
"simple life" in the Stone Age, and those who understood
how to make and how to use implements of
bronze. Metal must have revolutionized the habits
of the people, fostered development, and marked
progress as the Age advanced; for with metal
appliances there were greater possibilities, and from
the fact that while some used bronze others were
content with flint, it would appear that then, perhaps,
more than at any other time, the more advanced were
sharply separated from those who, possessing lesser
intelligence and possibly fewer opportunities, stayed
behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Dawn of Progress.</h3>

<p>The more advanced Britons and the men of the
later Bronze Age in other countries improved the
patterns of their tools, the basis of which was found
in flint implements, which in the later Neolithic
period had become more varied. Even then they
had hammer, saw, chisel, borer, spear or javelin, and
arrow-point. They had also a variety of knives;
some of curious sickle-like forms. There are weapons
of war and weapons of defence, and some obviously
used for the more peaceful arts and domestic purposes.
As the collector secures specimens of the
rarer types of bronze and metal objects coming to us
from those far-off days, we read the story of the
evolution of the race, and can picture in our minds
the onward march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span></p>

<p>The Romans did not find the ancient Britons quite
savages, and we sigh with regret when we think of
the numberless relics of priceless value&mdash;of bronze
and of even more precious metals&mdash;which existed
then, but which have perished long ago. The melting-pot
has been a terribly fierce enemy to the
collector of copper and brass, and it is really
wonderful how many rare objects of the Bronze
Age remain&mdash;prehistoric only in that we have no
authentic records of the happenings of that period.
We have, however, abundant evidence of the importance
of that Age in the bronzes preserved to us for
so long by Mother Earth, and now carefully tended
by museum curators and private collectors. Among
the fine examples we possess in our national collections
are the ornamental bucklers of which some
have been found in Wales and other places. That represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in Fig. 2 (1) came from the Thames Valley,
and Fig. 3 (2) from the peat bogs near Aberystwyth;
both may be seen in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Some exceptional hoards have been found in
Ireland, notably the bronzes which were discovered
in 1825 in a part of Whigsborough, called Derreens,
in King's Co. It is surmised that although the land
is now boggy the soil was at one time under cultivation,
and from indications it would appear as if the
bronzefounder had worked on the spot. In Fig. 4
several representative implements found in that
hoard are pictured; their descriptions are as follows:
Fig. 4 (1 and 3), palstaves; (5, 6, and 7), daggers;
(2) a pear-shaped bell; (4 and 8) curved trumpets,
all specimens of the latter part of the Bronze Age or
of the beginning of the Iron Age. Many fine bronze
vessels, chiefly without feet, have been found in
Ireland. The two examples shown in Figs. 5 and 6
represent the way in which they were made, especially
Fig. 5 (1), in which the riveting of the plates will
be observed. Fig. 6 (2) has been designated an urn.
Both of these late bronzes are in the British Museum,
along with other Irish finds. In the same collection
there is a trumpet of horn with rings or bands of
studs, the mouthpiece being at the side. It is a
curious relic of an Irish musician, found some years
ago at Drimoleague, Co. Cork.</p>


<h3>London Relics.</h3>

<p>London has been the site of an important camp,
town, or city ever since man lived in the marshes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and upon the banks of Old Father Thames, and
among the finds in the neighbourhood have been
relics of every period of British civilization; and as a
natural consequence London possesses representative
collections of the Bronze Age, as well as of later
periods. Collectors have many opportunities of buying,
as well as of inspecting prehistoric bronzes in
museums and in less important private collections.
Some of these antiquities are of good form and
possess a beauty of their own. The vivid green,
relieved with deeper shades, with which age has
painted these ancient relics gives them a peculiar
charm, and it would be vandalism indeed to attempt
to "clean" the celts and knives which antiquaries
handle with such veneration and care.</p>


<h3>The Beauty of Ancient Art.</h3>

<p>During the last few years more attention has
been given to the beauty of the workmanship of the
early objects of brass and copper relics of prehistoric
peoples, especially of the people who inhabited this
country in pre-Roman days. The London museums
contain very representative examples. To many the
Guildhall Museum is of special interest, in that every
object there has been found within the confines of
the City of London. There are implements of the
chase and of war and peace. For instance, in the
cases containing weapons which may have been used
for defence against wild animals, as well as for
aggressive campaigns, there are bronze celts, some
socketed with loops, side by side with a very fine
tool and two small lumps of copper, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
discovered near the celt. These latter represent the
unfinished material ready for the crucible and for the
alloy which was to turn them into a bronze of special
hardness. In the same case there are leaf-shaped
swords and daggers of rapier form. There are also
spear-heads of slender shapes with sockets extending
near to the point of the weapon; and spear shaft-sockets
of bronze, some of which were found in
Fetter Lane.</p>

<p>Of the late Celtic period there are examples of
personal objects, and it may be noted that duplicates
of similar antiquities to those deposited in the
Museum are on sale in a great number of shops in
London, and now and then quite important parcels
of these interesting metallic mementoes of peoples
unknown come under the hammer. Such trinkets
include bronze fibul√¶, some enamelled, others of plain
metal. A very beautiful specimen terminating with
a roughly formed snake's head was found on the
Thames bank near Hammersmith, on the site of
reputed pile dwellings, some little time ago. In the
same locality a bronze bowl and a mount were found
soon afterwards. From the river near Battersea
came a bronze shield, specially interesting in that
it was decorated with enamelled ornaments. Horse-bits
with enamelled rosettes have also been found in
London. Perhaps one of the most interesting relics
of that early age was a British helmet of copper, also
decorated with enamels, found near Waterloo Bridge.
In the Guildhall Museum there is a brooch made
with a bow and pin in one piece, and quite a number
of other styles of bronze fibul√¶. There are bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
hairpins, too, some of the heads being decorated.
There are Celtic tweezers, armlets of bronze, and
many rings.</p>

<p>To the inquisitive who like to inquire into the
processes of making things and to their sources, the
remains of ancient workshops represented by lumps
of copper, strips of bronze, and objects partly formed,
are of special interest. There are bows, showing
another advance in civilization. There are spoons,
too, of circular form, hammered into shape. It has
been said that bowls and spoons are the earliest signs
of domesticity and civilization. Our ancestors, who
lived on the seashore, made use of large shells, which
gave them the cue to the fashioning of a shallow
dish, which eventually became a bowl. The wings of
the valves of the oyster and the pecten may have
given the suggestion of a handle to a primitive spoon.
Ethnologists have said that the broken cocoanut in
the South Seas was the bowl of the primitive tribes,
and from it vessels in clay were moulded.</p>


<p>The Useful Bronzes, the Prototypes of Later Brasses.</p>

<p>The beautiful bronzes of the later part of the
Bronze Age include objects showing the gradual
development and progress of the race. Not only are
the weapons those likely to be used in defence
against attacks from wild animals rather than for
aggressive purposes, and the domestic bronzes of
more civilized forms, but there are in addition implements
of husbandry. In Ireland some very
pronounced sickles and reaping-hooks have been
found. There are also musical instruments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sounding horns, among them curved trumpets of
bronze.</p>

<p>Many interesting although isolated finds have been
made, such as a curious bronze or brass bucket with
corrugated flutes, which was found at Weybridge, in
Surrey, experts placing it among the relics of the
early Iron Age. From Faversham, in Kent, many
bronze mirrors have been secured, some of them
being very ornamental, the backs being engraved all
over. In the North of England several interesting
finds have been made, too. Some of especial value
were discovered in Heathery Burn Cave, Co. Durham;
they consisted of domestic utensils which
were probably used at the extreme end of the
Bronze Age.</p>

<p>Among frequent finds is the patera or drinking-bowl,
which must, of course, be distinguished from
the patine, which was a flat dish with a raised rim,
used for serving up meat or fish. Indeed, it would
appear that some of the peoples who dwelt in those
far-off ages of which we have no written history
were more advanced in civilization and in the arts
and crafts than we usually realize. Modern research
has revealed much that was hitherto unknown, and
scientists, explorers, and antiquaries now hold the
ancients in much greater respect than formerly&mdash;they
no longer regard them as "savages," although
they may class them with the "barbarians" of more
modern Europe.</p>

<p>Professor Petrie, the famous Egyptologist, when
speaking on his wonderful researches some little time
ago, said mankind had had a long past. That past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
leads to the present, and without a knowledge of the
present and to some extent of the intermediate ages
we cannot fully understand the past. It is the curios
of antiquity which help us, and lead up by slow
degrees to the present; this is understood by the
curio-hunter, and realized more and more as he goes
further into the past of nations. The curios of the
Bronze Age are not limited in locality. They are
found in continents far removed from Western
civilization, for in the remains of ancient Peruvians
there are tools of bronze belonging to their far-off
past. The Incas were not only adepts at working
the precious metals with tools of bronze, but they
were clever workers of other raw materials. They
possessed beautiful textiles of cotton and wool and
were noted agriculturists, having implements of tillage
made of bronze.</p>


<h3>The Forger at Work.</h3>

<p>A warning note is often sounded by those who
have paid dearly for their experience. It is needed,
for there are many pitfalls for the unwary, especially
in his researches among the relics of the Bronze Age
and periods which have been much copied by the
makers of modern antiques. It is worthy of note
that in the middle of the nineteenth century several
Birmingham firms in making bronzed inkstands,
bracket lights, candelabra, and figures supporting
lamps, copied the antique very closely, one noted
firm announcing on their trade circulars that their
designs were "according to Greek, Roman, and
Gothic ornaments." Examples of such comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
modern work, when discovered tarnished and neglected,
may sometimes have a close resemblance to
real antiques, and even the curios of still greater
antiquity&mdash;especially Egyptian curiosities&mdash;have
been much forged. The forger&mdash;or, as he would
prefer to be called, the maker of replicas&mdash;is still
at work.</p>

<p>It is from the curios in metal and the antiquities in
stone which have been discovered, chiefly in comparatively
recent years, that we are able to read with
understanding the allusions made by classic writers
to domestic life as it was in ancient Greece and
Rome. The records of the art of Greece become
more real when we have gazed upon the beautiful
and graceful statues and the furniture of the palace
and domain for which the artists and metal-workers
of those days were so justly celebrated.</p>

<p>Even the public school boy takes a greater interest
in his studies when he recognizes in the furnishings
of his home antiquities from Greece or those lands in
which that once powerful nation founded colonies.</p>


<h3>Grecian Bronzes.</h3>

<p>In the modern replicas of antiques, and in the
fashioning of the common household bronzes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
present day, the craftsman, perhaps unconsciously,
gains inspiration from the older race of artists in
metals. Indeed, the nearer the workman adheres to
the form of the statues and domestic decorative
metal-work of the ancients, the more likely he is to
succeed in imparting refinement to the modern home.
Ancient Greece was the nursery of art and the training
ground of the athlete and of the model who
served as the type of the goddesses whose perfect
forms and attributes were regarded as worthy of the
divinities her sons and daughters worshipped. Most
of the metal objects coming to us from classic days
are of bronze, toned and patinated. Images of the
gods and goddesses worshipped by the ancient
Greeks were to be found in every house. Wealthy
patrons employed the artist in metal to produce idols
and appointments for the numerous temples they
built. It was the worship of many pagan deities that
found work for many craftsmen. The very multiplicity
of the gods served the purposes of trade,
hence the supporters of pagan practices and worship
found in the metal-workers and artists who wrought
such things powerful allies. We read in Biblical
accounts of that day that the introduction of Christianity
caused no small stir amongst them, and incited
Demetrius, the silversmith, and others to rise up
against the "new religion," which gave no immediate
promises of employment of metal-workers to compensate
them for the loss of trade in idols. It was
thus that so much that is beautiful when regarded
as merely artistic bronze figures was made. Among
the favourite deities whose emblematic bronzes have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
been preserved to us are Diana, Venus, Mercury, and
Hercules. They rank with the gods of brass of the
heathen, and according to their classic beauty are
admired with the idols of metal from India and
Africa (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>).</p>

<p>In all these treasures from the old world, little
known or understood now, there is a blend of the
decorative and artistic and the more utilitarian objects
of the household. The slaves of the old families
often lived luxurious lives, although the goodwill
of their patrons and owners might be fickle. They
had their duties, and the metal objects they handled
and often skilfully manipulated are still preserved in
our museums. These were often fashioned with the
same grace as the statues which adorned porticoes
and halls.</p>

<p>The ornamental objects of Greek workmanship
include useful braziers or bronze tripods which gave
heat and also served as purifiers; for into their round
brass dishes were thrown perfumes to correct the
smell of the coals and charcoal, which were then held
to be injurious. Such braziers were also used by the
Romans, and even in the Middle Ages were not uncommon,
pepper and cloves being then burned for
fragrance.</p>


<h3>Relics of Roman Occupation.</h3>

<p>Although many beautiful objects have been imported
into this country by collectors and dealers
bought in Rome itself, and in Italian and other
continental cities where Roman remains have been
found, it is the relics of the Roman occupation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Britain which take first place in our estimation
among the valued curios of that great nation. These
have been found in many places, often quite unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Modern London, like modern Rome, stands in
part on ruins of an older city. Hence it is that when
foundations are being dug and excavations to some
15 to 20 feet are made, relics of Roman London and
of Saxon and early Norman buildings which were
built in subsequent ages upon the older ruins come
to light. It is amidst these ruins and the debris of
old architecture that metal curiosities are often found.
Copper and brass have not perished to the same
extent as iron and more corrosive metals. In
London, Bath, Chester, and cities which were famous
many centuries ago, the earliest metal curiosities
are unearthed. But many of the most valued have
been found where least expected, for it must be
remembered that even the sites of many old cities
have been lost, and green fields now cover the old
foundations.</p>

<p>It is a little disappointing at first, when a collection
of Roman antiquities is under examination, to find
that they bear a striking resemblance to modern
appliances&mdash;especially is that so in the cooking
utensils. Most of these early vessels are of bronze;
some, however, are of pure copper, mostly covered
over with green patina. The useful seems to have
predominated over the ornamental; possibly it is
that the more substantial cooking-pots and pans have
remained, although lighter and more ornamental
objects have perished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The pots and saucepans are indeed remarkably
like those which are now used for similar purposes.
This has been remarked by many who have had to
do with the uncovering of long buried ruins. A
writer describing a Roman kitchen attached to the
villa of a patrician family of note in the Republican
era before Augustus assumed the purple, which had
been uncovered in Rome, said, "The culinary utensils
found there are much like our own, made of brass,
some of them dipped or plated over with silver."
They consisted of kettles with feet, with a dome-shaped
opening under them, a hollow cylinder which
entered into the kettle base so that the fire could
penetrate it.</p>

<p>Many of these utensils, whilst possessing great
strength and lasting qualities, were not altogether
plain, for they were covered with foliated ornament
like the saucepan illustrated in Fig. 7. The saucepans
without handles were something like a caldron
on feet; many, however, were fitted with bail handles,
by which they could be hung over the fire by the aid
of a tripod. The metal of which these early vessels
were made varied, for although some were of bronze,
some were made of a yellowish brass, like one found
in London near Ludgate. The Guildhall Museum is
the best place to find a thoroughly representative
collection of Roman metal-work. In the cases
there are curious saucer-like bowls with and without
handles, many spoons of bronze, and a variety of
ladles, some of which have long and narrow bowls;
and there are some culinary strainers, not unlike
the modern colander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many ewers and some bowls or basins
of bronze. In Fig. 8 is shown a ewer of hammered
copper, the handle having at the time it was made, or
at some later period, been strengthened with brass
wire, which is in part flattened and stamped with
medallions giving the vessel an exceedingly ornamental
appearance. This curious piece is to be seen
in the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>

<p>Among the more important kitchen accessories
which have been discovered on the sites of Roman
towns are bronze scales not unlike miniatures of
the steelyards once common in England, and still
used by butchers. Then there are brass gridirons,
dripping-pans, and cups of bronze. There are also
copper pails for cooling wine, and in a few instances
bronze stands for the wine amphor√¶. It is almost
impossible to point out the sites which are likely
to yield the explorer the best results, neither is it
possible to locate the town where metal-work has
been found to the greatest extent, for all old camping-grounds
and towns once occupied by Roman
troops or residential cities during Roman occupation
contain what has been thrown away as useless or
has been buried accidentally.</p>

<p>The collector is delighted with the many little
objects which can be bought, trifling matters when
seen separately, but very interesting when collectively
displayed.</p>

<h3>Interesting Toilet Requisites.</h3>

<p>During excavations on the site of the National
Safe Deposit Company's premises in Walbrook quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a number of beautifully formed small objects were
found. Indeed, such curios (by no means uncommonly
met with on sale in curio shops) are very
numerous, and include toilet implements, armlets of
twisted copper wire, finger rings of bronze, dress
fasteners, pins, fibul√¶, tweezers, key rings, bodkins,
and needles.</p>

<p>The looking-glass is of course a modern invention,
but Greek and Roman maidens learned the art of
finishing their toilet in the reflective "glass" of the
shining pool, and later by the aid of mirrors of
highly polished metal made by the craftsmen of
Rome; some of which have been preserved. The
surface to which this reflective polish was given was
of copper alloyed with antimony and lead. Such
mirrors were sometimes hung to the girdle, a custom
not unknown to Shakespeare, who frequently makes
mention of it.</p>


<h3>Artificial Lighting.</h3>

<p>Artificial light has been a necessity to man ever
since primeval days. The whole story of the discovery
of fire-making and the light it gave is an
enchanting romance. The contrivances for procuring
and lighting a fire and for the betterment of artificial
light have been many, and throughout the ages they
have received perhaps greater attention by the inventor
than any other requirement of the race. Of
all the curios of the period under review none have
been more prolific than those associated with artificial
light. The lamps of ancient Rome, of beautiful bronze
and brass, contrasted with the clay or terra-cotta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
lamps of cruder forms which have been found in
such quantities. Their chased patterns were often
modelled on the earlier Greek vases, so many of
which are to be seen in the British Museum among
the rarities of the metal collector. No collection of
copper and brass would be complete without examples
of the arts and crafts of Rome, so beautifully exemplified
in the charming lamps to be carried in the
hand, to stand on pedestals, and for suspension from
the ceiling. There was something in their ornamentation
which carried them beyond the works of the
utilitarian maker. A celebrated historian, referring
to the lights of ancient Rome, speaks of their matchless
grace and simplicity, and says, "They afford
traces of decoration showing an elevation in the
ornamentation of common articles of every-day
use." The Roman lamp of bronze was carried
everywhere the conquering armies went, and in
Roman settlements in France, Italy, and in Northern
Africa, as well as in Britain, the native artificers in
copper and bronze saw in them designs to be imitated;
and after the Empire of Rome had fallen, the
models which emanated from the Imperial city
served as the designs for lamps in many countries
centuries afterwards. The illustrations shown in
Figs. 9 and 10 represent bronze lamps&mdash;the former,
Fig. 9, is cast, and is an early example; Fig. 10,
however, is of a later period, and it is made of
brass inlaid with copper. The examples found in
this and other countries may be divided into two
groups, those distinctly Roman and of early date
and those of the days when the Christian religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
was recognized by the Emperors and the State.
These latter are known by the decorations upon
them.</p>


<h3>Statues and Monuments.</h3>

<p>Reference has already been made to the beautiful
statuettes of Greece. There are others, to many
grand in their conceptions, the work of Roman
modellers, many representing Apollo, Hercules, Mars,
and Mercury having been found. In the British
Museum there are some wonderfully striking heads
of several of the Emperors, and other men whose
portraits have been handed on to us in monuments
of stone, and upon coins and medallions, the die-sinkers
of which so faithfully portrayed the men they
pictured. The names of many of the most famous
artists are known, and collectors rejoice over fresh
examples of their handiwork. It is, however, the
general characteristics of the Roman worker in metal
as a whole that connoisseurs recognize and appreciate,
and the true connoisseur is always searching
for some greater artist's work than he has hitherto
been familiar with. He is on the look-out for the
very best among art treasures.</p>

<p>An amusing story has been told of a modern
manufacturer who was very fond of inserting in his
advertisements paragraphs calling attention to his
modern works of art, which he said were "acknowledged
by connoisseurs to be the best." "Father,"
said his little boy one day, "what do you mean by a
connoisseur?" "A connoisseur, my boy," answered
the manufacturer of copper goods, "is an eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
authority&mdash;an authority, in short, who admits that <em>our</em>
goods are the best."</p>

<p>We are apt to look upon the beautiful brass grilles
and copper lock-plates of medi√¶val days as the
earliest examples of these metals in lock-making,
the earliest locks found on old doors and muniment
chests being chiefly of iron. But when we go back
to still earlier times and examine the relics of
Roman London, we find key-rings and keys of
bronze, some very ornamental, too. One beautiful
little key found near All Hallows Church has a bow
terminating in a small spur. Another bronze key
found near St. Swithin's, in Cannon Street, has a
ridged annular bow, with a short square stem. Other
keys are equally decorative; the locks, too, are in
many instances ornamental, although in design and
workmanship they fall short of the pinnacle of fame
reached by the lockmakers in later Gothic times.</p>


<h3>Romano-British Art.</h3>

<p>Many readers in searching for curios of the
Romano-British period in this country will recall
the fact that the ancient Britons possessed bronze;
and doubtless we should be doing an injustice to the
more enlightened dwellers in Britain before Roman
occupation, and contemporary with it, if we did not
admit that possibly some of the relics of that period
now dubbed Roman belonged to those more entitled
to our regard, for Albion was their native land.</p>

<p>On the Thames Embankment, facing the Houses
of Parliament, there is that famous bronze group
perpetuating the memory of the British Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Boadicea in her war chariot. The Romans made
their famous paved roads as they pushed their
outposts and line of camps farther north and west.
The wheels of many British war chariots were made
of, or hooped with, brass, and possibly the brass or
bronze wheels, such as are represented in that group
on the Embankment once covered by the flowing
river, may have rattled over the roads made by the
conquerors; such chariots, with their appointments
of bronze and ornamental horse trappings, showed
much skill in their fashioning. A poet gives voice to
their use in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="verse">"On the bright axle turns the bidden wheel<br /></span>
<span class="verse">Of sounding brass, the polish'd axle steel."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<h3>A Well Staged Exhibit.</h3>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to remind readers that
there is a peculiar attraction in a well staged exhibit&mdash;public
or private. A case of Roman and still
earlier bronzes may be made attractive by an
arrangement giving a gradation of subject and
inclusive of the plainer types with the more delicately
formed ornamental trinkets. A very fine example
of how to arrange such a collection is seen in one
of the rooms in Stafford House, the new home of
the London Museum. The entire collection, representative
of various periods of the Roman occupation
of Britain, so carefully mounted, is worthy of close
inspection. It includes many rare pieces, one being
an early Roman lamp, which was found in Greenwich
and is said to be unique among London curios.
Indeed, it is probable that none so fine, nor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
exactly the same design, has been found in England.
This we are able to reproduce (see <a href="#Page_209">Fig. 50</a>). The
newly arranged London Museum is likely to be a
rendezvous of Londoners and their friends from the
country, for not only are there early antiquities
in copper and brass, but many fascinating curios
arranged in historical sequence, showing the development
in metal-work as it was fashioned by London
smiths and founders, and the progress made by other
craftsmen as kings and queens came and went and
the London as we know it to-day was being evolved.</p>

<p>As the collector of copper and brass assembles his
treasures and arranges them according to the different
periods in which they were made, it is always the
household utensils which predominate. As time
goes on their number increases and the ornamental
blends with the useful; but the increase in the
variety is only in proportion to the gradual extension
of the number of other household curios of contemporary
dates.</p>

<p>The period under review, for convenience termed
medi√¶val, extends in actual fact from the rougher
days of the Norman sovereigns to those when bluff
King Hal held court and Elizabeth made so many
"grand tours" among the country seats of her people.
At the beginning of this period the furniture of even
the nobility and wealthy ecclesiastics was very scanty,
and when the proud barons moved from one castle
to another they carried with them all their household
furnishings, even their more treasured culinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
utensils of copper and brass. They stowed them
away along with their jewels and their other belongings
in oak coffers, which in the earliest days were
made so that they could be carried on poles by
retainers.</p>

<h3>Domestic Brasswork.</h3>

<p>In medi√¶val days the metal-work was "home
made," that is to say, it was the work of retainers
and those who were employed upon an estate. The
old smiths not only worked in iron but wrought
copper and brass, and the founders were building up
a reputation; and their chief men were laying down
rules for the guidance of the craftsmen. The influence
exerted upon the metal-work of this country
by the trade guilds of London is referred to in
<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>. In their prosperity no doubt the
kitchens of the once powerful guilds were filled with
cooking vessels indicative of the feasts held by the
freemen of the different crafts. Some may say there
are still evidences of such feasts; but most of the
cooking vessels of early days perished in the Great
Fire, although doubtless there are relics of a later
period to be found in the kitchens and cellars of the
Guildhall and some of the lesser halls.</p>

<p>Some of the companies, if they have lost their
treasures, still possess records which are helpful to the
antiquary, and we naturally turn to the parchments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and books of the Worshipful Company of Founders,
and there, appropriately enough, it is written that at
one time they had jurisdiction over the manufacture
of candlesticks, buckles, spurs, stirrups, straps, lavers,
pots, ewers, and basins of brass and latten. The
mark of the mystery was early made a ewer, a
ewer and two candlesticks being given to the
Founders in 1590, when they obtained a grant of
arms; the motto they adopted was: "God is the
only Founder."</p>

<p>The foundries of the craftsmen, workers, and
casters of brass, latten, and kindred alloys in London
were chiefly in and near Lothbury, among their
most noted products being candlesticks and spice
mortars&mdash;two staples which have become nearly
obsolete, although none would say that the founding
of metal is as yet an obsolete craft. Thus it is
change and development are seen everywhere in
production. The chief privileges of the Founders
have gone, although they still take some little part
in the stamping of weights and measures; but that,
too, has become a Government duty. The Founders
have some interesting pieces of plate, but not much
copper. Their best example of their own craft is the
ancient poor-box of copper which was presented to
the Company by Mr. Stephen Pilchard in 1653, the
year in which he was Upper Warden.</p>

<p>The feeding of man has always been the first duty
of those who took charge of domestic arrangements,
and we can readily understand that the caldron or
cooking-pot was the earliest vessel. Its use may be
regarded as universal, for it is found to have existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
everywhere (see <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>). In medi√¶val
England the feasting of the poor and the feeding
of scores of retainers in the baronial halls and in
the great ecclesiastical buildings, where hospitality
and charity were rife, necessitated immense boiling-pots.
Some of those referred to under "Domestic
Utensils" (<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>) seem to some too large
for practical purposes. It may, however, be pointed
out that there are many large cooking-pots in use
even at the present time; and copper caldrons of
large size are used in hospitals and infirmaries.
Quite recently there appeared in the public Press
photographs of a well-known Countess making an
Irish stew at Liberty Hall, Dublin, stirring round
the contents with a wooden stirrer and lading out
bowlfuls of soup with a metal scoop; it was food for
the sufferers through the strike at that time going
on in Dublin. It is thus that the poor of all ages
have been fed. As kitchen operations were confined
to lesser areas and smaller vessels were needed by
individual families when patriarchal systems were
broken up, they were but replicas in miniature of the
larger caldrons and vessels which had become too
large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span></p>

<p>It is wisely said, "Fingers were made before
spoons," a fact true enough, but as time went on and
the habits and customs of men and women became
less rough, although as yet hardly refined, a need
sprang up for utensils for personal use. Hitherto
cooking forks and spoons were used in the kitchen,
but the hunting-knife mostly served at table. It is
true spoons were in use in very early times and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
by the common people. At first of iron or wood,
afterwards made of brass and latten, they are found
wherever there are remains of medi√¶val dwellings.
A Scotchman is said to have declared that "the
discovery of hot broth was an epoch in the evolution
of man, and that as the ladle is to the pot so is the
spoon to the bowl."</p>

<p>Such brass ewers and basins, known as aquamaniles,
mostly of bronze (one of Continental make is illustrated
in Fig. 11) were used for the purpose of
washing the hands, over which the water was poured.
They were used in connection with bowls. Another
type of laving ewer is that of the gemellions, made
in pairs, one portion being held under a person's
hands while water was poured out of the spouted
bowl. Gemellions seem to have been the somewhat
clumsy prototypes of the more convenient jug and
bowl of later days. The use of ewers and basin
was very necessary both before and after meals
when knives and spoons were little used and it was
no uncommon thing for two persons to eat out of
one dish.</p>

<p>In medi√¶val days even domestic articles were
frequently decorated, for English and European
metal-workers had caught the figure work of the
Oriental school. Their ornament took the form of
hunting and battle scenes. Sometimes patrons were
eulogized, and flattering inscriptions covered the
objects wrought for them by their servile dependents.
In Fig. 18 there is shown a bucket or bath vessel
now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, rather
an unusual piece of early metal-work and an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
medi√¶val curio. Not long ago a similar
bucket was dug up in the neighbourhood of Weybridge.</p>

<p>We are apt to regard with disdain what we term
the grandmotherly legislation which tampers with
the liberty of the subject. The present day, however,
is not alone remarkable for regulations by which the
home life of the nation is controlled. The Norman
law which ordered "lights out" when curfew rang cut
short the "overtime" of the worker of that day. So
stringent was the enforcement of that law that not a
glimmer of light must be seen after the appointed
time. To darken or extinguish the dying fire on
the hearth the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couvre de feu</i> became a feature. Such
covers of well authenticated antiquity are rare; the
one illustrated in Fig. 12 is a well-preserved example
now in the Bolton Museum.</p>


<h3>Metal Signs and Badges.</h3>

<p>In the early days when serfdom had not long
ceased and the retainers of the nobles had not
won their full freedom or independence, signs and
symbols of their allegiance to some chief or overlord
were plentiful. The Crusaders brought back with
them signs, amulets, and various objects which they
wore with more or less superstitious belief. The
pilgrims to the most noted shrines in this country
followed suit, and all these various purposes and
medi√¶val customs have furnished the curio-hunter
with many delightful reminders of the "good old
days" when superstition and almost idolatry were
rife. Old Father Thames has preserved many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
them for centuries, and twentieth-century collectors
are richer thereby.</p>

<p>In the Guildhall Museum in London there is a
very complete and representative collection of
pilgrims' signs. Although many of them are made
of a soft metal, there are others of good copper and
brass. At one time they must have been very
plentiful, for very prolific have the finds been in
the neighbourhood of London Bridge and in and
around Southwark. These signs or badges were
secured and worn by the pilgrims who set out to the
chief shrines, notably that of St. Thomas √† Becket at
Canterbury. Chaucer in his <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite> has
told that there were many traders in pilgrim signs
in Canterbury city, so that all were enabled to
possess themselves of such symbols, many of which
they threw upon the shrine, and others retained them
as talismans against danger on the return journey.
The pilgrims wore a variety of emblems&mdash;the more
devout, it is said, preferred the cross; others carried
with them on their journey little metal figures
of St. George, St. Katherine, St. Christopher, or
other saint with his or her symbol. St. Agnes
was represented by a lamb, St. John by an eagle,
and St. Dorothy by a basket of fruit. Perhaps the
most favoured sign purchased in Canterbury was an
equestrian figure of St. Thomas √† Becket. Some of
the emblems were worn as protectors against evil,
and such signs were almost invariably on horse
trappings; indeed, such amulets have been perpetuated
almost up to the present day. There are
several circular discs in the museum referred to, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to date from the twelfth century, upon these are
embossed two horned animals; another badge of a
little later date, in copper, has upon it a shield of
arms surrounded by three mythical dragons; it was
found in Ludgate Hill. Yet another on which is a
shield charged with seven stars, said to be of
fourteenth-century workmanship, was found some
time ago on the site of the old General Post Office
in St Martin's-le-Grand.</p>

<p>The retainers of noblemen wore private badges by
which they were known; these were mostly of brass
or bronze, and sometimes they were gilded. They
were frequently worn when on a journey as a passport.
Such badges in the form of circles and
lozenges were usually furnished with a loop for
suspension, and became well known. They served
a similar purpose to the distinctive livery of later
days.</p>


<h3>Ornamental Trinkets.</h3>

<p>The household ornaments, trinkets, and little
articles of personal adornment which have been
preserved tell not only of female vanity but of
masculine love of ornament. It would appear that
the use of bronze lingered on for centuries after it
had nominally been displaced by brass; especially
was that the case in decorative objects and metal
ornament. The metals known as bronze, copper,
and brass are, however, much intermixed in their
use.</p>

<p>The objects which can be collected include
brooches, rings, pins, needles, bodkins, and thimbles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of brass. Buckles are very numerous, and varied in
form; some are heart-shaped, others have ends cut
out to form a trefoil and are decorated with a
pierced fleur-de-lis. The story of the pin, the
smallest and yet the most used metal object preserved,
is very interesting. At one time it was
made by hand from brass wire, the head being twisted
round and round until it had the appearance of a
solid knob. The Pinners were in years gone by an
important guild, and in 1376 returned two men to
the Common Council of London. In the reign of
Henry VII an Act of Parliament was passed compelling
the Pinners to solder fast to the shank the
head of the pin, and directing that the pin itself
should be "smooth, rounded, filed, and sharpened."
Very laborious indeed must have been the making
of pins in those days. There were pins, however, of
an earlier date, for it is recorded that on one occasion
when the men of Athens had gone out to battle only
one returned. He was met by an infuriated mob of
women, who were so enraged at the loss of their
husbands that Herodotus tells us they pulled the
pins out from their garments and stabbed him to
death. There were bronze pins in Rome, too, and
we are told that even the safety-pin of to-day is by
no means new, for among the collectable objects in
brass are prehistoric safety-pins.</p>

<p>Half a century ago, when little girls went to school
they carried with them the inevitable pin poppet,
some of which receptacles for pins and other similar
sundries were of wood, but many were brass; some
met with among old metal curios are quite handsomely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
decorated. Another indispensable object is
the button, so many of which are of metal, many
decorative, some inscribed, and others ornamented
with portraits. There are little brass sleeve-links,
worn in Tudor days, to be met with, and some
curious brass studs which were worn by men in
the shirt fronts of the early Georgian period. There
are clasps of purses and books and casket mounts of
brass, some of which date back to the fifteenth century.
The older mounts of purses, so-called, would
be more correctly described as the mounts of
gipcieres; the gipciere was a kind of pouch formerly
worn at the girdle; the name is also spelled <em>gipser</em>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i7">"A <em>gipser</em> all of silk</div>
<div class="verse i0">Hung at his girdle white as morn√© silk."</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse author"><span class="smcap">Chaucer.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sometimes the mounts were inscribed with
mottoes; one found in Brooks' Wharf, London,
believed to be of fourteenth-century workmanship,
is inscribed "<span class="f75">CREATOREM CELI ET TERRE ET IN
IESVM</span>." Other objects in brass are girdle ends,
some of which are shaped like acorns and others
are of ivy-leaf design. Among ornamental bronzes
which can be worn, and in larger sizes hung upon
the wall, there are plaques, many of the earliest
being copied from antique gems. Plaquettes in
bronze were common in the sixteenth century.</p>


<h3>Arms and Armour.</h3>

<p>A volume might well be taken up with describing
medi√¶val arms and armour. It is true iron and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
steel are the chief metals in the making of weapons,
but brass and bronze are closely allied with some of
the armaments of war. Many of the small medi√¶val
cannon were of brass, and not a few of the guns, or
"hand cannon," were of that metal.</p>

<p>In the days of Elizabeth the musketeer carried, in
addition to an unwieldy weapon, his flask of powder,
touch-box, and burning match. The match-box
was a tube of copper pierced with small holes, and in
it the lighted match could be conveyed safely. The
powder-horn was at first of real horn, but in time it
became a copper flask. Many of the old flasks were
exceedingly ornate, and were often ornamented with
hunting scenes worked up in repouss√© on the copper
sides. The spur-makers were important craftsmen
in early days, and under the name of the Guild of
Loriners ranked with the City companies. It is true
that the spur rowels of six, eight, or even twelve
points were generally of iron, but the collector of
metal finds many interesting specimens made
entirely of brass. One pair of spurs in the reign of
Henry VIII consist of fourteen brass points, the
neck of the rowel being shaped like a peacock and
embossed with brass rosettes. Our finest collection
of armour and of ceremonial metal-work&mdash;that
splendid collection which dates from quite early
times, finding its greatest strength and massive
grandeur in late medi√¶val days and its artistic
ornament in the richly damascened armour of lesser
weight of the Stuarts&mdash;is rightly housed in that
greatest of English strongholds, the Tower of London.
It is there that the antiquary and the arch√¶ologist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
love to wander, and in the vast recesses of those
dungeons and prison-like towers read history.
There is an abundance of metal everywhere. Guns
and cannon and mortars of historic fame lie about
in the open. The Bloody Tower, nearly opposite
the Traitors' Gate, the Middle Tower, the Byward
Tower, and many others of equal interest may be
seen. To some the Regalia with its crowns, swords,
and sceptres of state, ampulla, spoon, salt-cellars,
maces, and orders of merit, are the greatest attraction.
The curio collector, however, finds his way to the
museum and admires and perhaps envies the
quaint and curious guns, powder-horns, and trophies
of war. He is in the midst of the England of the
Middle Ages, with its jousts and tournaments, shut
out by the thick walls of the White Tower from the
hurry and bustle of the traffic and commerce of the
twentieth century.</p>

<p>The magnificent armour in Hertford House&mdash;the
Wallace collection&mdash;is a delight to those who love
to see in arms and armour the perfection of beauty
of ornament and decoration. There are splendid
suits which look as bright as the day when they were
new. The half-suit of armour of Italian workmanship
made for Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara, inlaid
and damascened with gold and silver, is said to be
the finest in Europe. The staging of this splendid
collection was carried out by Mr. Guy Laking, the
Keeper of the King's Armour and Custodian of the
London Museum.</p>

<p>A fitting conclusion to this chapter is, surely, a
tribute to the armourers and founders and smiths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the Middle Ages, who worked so conscientiously and
made their work lasting. It has retained its beauty
and much of its ancient finish, notwithstanding atmospheric
influences; indeed, some of it gained added
beauty by oxidation.</p>

<p class="chapblock">The influence of the Guilds&mdash;Architectural metal-work&mdash;The door
knocker&mdash;Interior metal-work.</p>


<p>In all branches of art there seems to be a break
between the earlier medi√¶val and the later art which
was the outcome to some extent of the great Renaissance
or revival which swept over the Continent of
Europe and brought with it such a change in everything
appertaining to the beautiful. Whilst medi√¶val
metal-workers produced grand examples full of
design and ornament, influenced by the touch with
Eastern nations which the Crusaders gave them, the
later smiths and founders gradually evolved styles of
their own, more English to our ideas. The Renaissance
with its wealth of ornament did not so much
apply to copper and brass as it did to the metal-work
of the smith who forged that which was beautiful and
ornate in iron on his anvil. Yet some of those florid
designs were reproduced by the brassfounder.</p>

<p>After the Restoration the art treasures which had
been destroyed during the Commonwealth were
replaced, as evidenced by the Regalia in the Tower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
where there is so much silver-gilt and gold plate
which represents the more decorative art of that
period. In that famous collection of national
Regalia, symbols of office, and vessels used on rare
occasions, there is the alms-dish used for the distribution
of the King's doles on Maundy Thursday. It
bears the Royal cipher of William and Mary, and
contrasts with the other plate in that it is remarkably
plain, typical in its decoration with the earlier metal-work
of the days of Queen Anne and those years
which immediately followed her reign. When we
walk through some of the once select, although now
not much used, thoroughfares in London and admire
the stately old houses which may be seen still in
some of the Metropolitan squares, especially in the
open thoroughfare known as Queen Anne's Gate, we
are inclined to wonder whether after all "Queen
Anne is dead." That hackneyed expression used in
a humorous sense at times is certainly not true in
so far as the remarkable developments in building
operations and the characteristic decorations of
Queen Anne's day live still not only in the old
houses which are still undisturbed, but in the designs
and characteristic patterns which were then adopted
by metal-workers and others, their beauty and grace
being recognized to such an extent that they are
to-day among the much copied antiques.</p>


<h3>The Influence of the Guilds.</h3>

<p>It may be convenient here to refer to the influence
of the old City guilds, which for so long a time
acted beneficially, keeping the craftsmen of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
day up to the mark, maintaining the purity of metal
and other materials used, and encouraging and
fostering the attainment of the highest skill in
artistic workmanship.</p>

<p>The City Companies have long ceased to exercise
active control over individual craftsmen; some would
say that trade unions have taken their place, and
others would point to the altered conditions of manufacture
and of trade which exist now. None can
deny, however, that the influence of those early
pioneers is still felt, and the basis which they laid
down as the art of the later period of English craftsmanship,
amongst which we find the greater number
of our collectable curios, remains to-day the foundation
on which modern developments are built up.
The Braziers' Company was once an important guild in
connection with metal. Many years ago the Braziers
joined the Armourers, claiming, however, a monopoly
of all copper and brasswork. By an Authority
received from James II the members of the Braziers'
Company were granted the right to search and prove
all copper and brasswork wrought with a hammer
within the City of London. It is said that their
Charter is still in force, although their rights and
privileges are now sinecures. Few members of the
old City companies have now any direct connection
with the crafts with which their names are associated.
They exist, however, and use some of the funds at
their disposal for the encouragement and development
of the modern crafts which have evolved from
the older foundations with which they were associated.
Now and then important exhibitions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
held at which examples of the old and the new are
shown, not always redounding to the credit of the
antique. Some few years ago a very interesting
competitive exhibition was held at Ironmongers'
Hall at the instigation of the Worshipful Company
of Founders, by whom prizes were given for artistic
metal-work made by living craftsmen who had
studied antique metal-work and had caught somewhat
of the spirit of the old artists in copper and
brass. The competition was keen and many of
the exhibits very beautiful. The winner of the first
prize had modelled a goat from life. The second
prize went to the modeller of a calf which was cast in
bronze; the third prize being awarded for a splendidly
modelled lioness. In another division prizes
were given for bells; the first prize was awarded to the
founder of a church bell cast in loam, and the second
prize to the designer and founder of a bell on which
were exceedingly well-modelled representations of
the Resurrection. In all these examples the influence
of the antique was very conspicuous.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span></p>

<p>The impetus which has been given to modern
copper smithing by the Arts and Crafts Society
through its exhibitions has given quite a different
conception of the art from that which was formerly
held. Instead of being a common craft, working in
copper and brass has become one of the fine arts, a
hobby much practised, and the results appreciated.
The late William Morris, at one time President of
the Society, and Walter Crane, artists of no mean
order, exerted a great influence on the work of
exhibitors. They have raised the tone of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
done by amateurs and have been the means of
guiding modern workers in these metals in their
efforts to reproduce the antique. Curios and antiques
have served a double purpose associated with crafts
such as those under review, as they give the present-day
artist the foundations upon which to work.
They give them evidence of styles and designs which
have prevailed in the past and models upon which
to build the art of the future. Briefly, among the
best works of to-day fashioned on the arts and crafts
of the coppersmiths of old are the beautiful metal
dogs and fire-hearth appointments. There are the
copper grilles, exquisite in design and useful for
many purposes; copper lanterns and brass lamps of
great variety; copper candlesticks, as well as the
beaten metal candelabra and electroliers, also overmantel
panels and beaten copper roundels, all
worthy objects for the craftsmen of the present
day to follow. Perhaps the most elaborate productions
based on the antique are the ecclesiastical
brasses of which there is ample choice in the old
brasswork in so many cathedrals and parish
churches.</p>


<h3>Architectural Metal-Work.</h3>

<p>Many years ago architects not only designed the
main fabric and supervised the building of houses,
such as those incidentally referred to being erected
in the days of Queen Anne, but they were deeply
interested in the metal-work which acted as exterior
ornamentation, and to a large extent contributed to
the beauty of their architectural designs. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Great Fire of London swept away so much of the
ancient residential portion of the old city, and took
with it the Gothic and early medi√¶val churches,
there was a great revival in building operations.
Sir Christopher Wren and his fellow-workers put up
more than sixty new churches within the City, and
although to some extent the contour of the old
streets was observed, the newer buildings must have
presented an astonishing transformation scene, for
from the few old relics left of London before the
Fire we can form some slight idea of what the City
must have looked like then.</p>

<p>The collector of copper and brass takes an interest
in metal-work other than that which he can collect,
and admires works of art with which the architects
of olden times enriched their chief buildings. It is
true a considerable portion of the exterior metal-work
attached to the freehold, and of the gates and
palasades surrounding the more important erections,
are of iron. There are enough examples of copper-work,
however, to show us the skill of the old craftsmen
who worked on years after the Charter granted
by James II to the Braziers' Company had become
a dead letter. One of the most conspicuous and at
the same time decorative examples of copper-work
on the loftier buildings is found in the weather-vanes,
which were sometimes gilt, at others painted. In
the earlier days the emblems selected had some
bearing on the ownership of the building or the
purposes for which it was to be used. There were
well-known rules, too, governing the type of weather-vane.
These are recognizable in the older examples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
They have been neglected, however, in later years,
and the nondescript designs chosen by builders and
modelled according to the whim of the designer at
the present day show little regard for the principles
laid down by those early builders and metal-workers.
The etiquette of the weather-vane was simple enough
to observe. On towers, castles, and secular buildings
a banner was the correct device, whereas on
ecclesiastical edifices it was the barn-door fowl. It
is said by an old authority that the cock was the
emblem of clerical vigilance, not unassociated with
the Biblical story of St. Peter; others more sceptical
as to the origin tell us that the large tail of the barn-door
fowl was well suited to turn truly to the wind.
From these simple principles evolved established
rules which ordered that the coat-of-arms or crest of
the owner of a building should be incorporated in the
design of the weather-vane, and on ecclesiastical
buildings the symbol of the patron saint was to take
the place of the weather-cock. As typical examples
to be seen in London streets the weather-vanes on
the four turrets of the White Tower of the Tower fly
the Royal Arms in the form of miniature Royal
Standards. In Tudor days the emblem was usually
represented sitting on a slender pedestal, carrying an
upright rod on which the flag or decorated plate of
metal which acted as the weather-vane was attached.
In the accompanying illustrations three types of
symbolical weather-vanes are shown. Fig. 13 represents
one of the copper vanes on Billingsgate Fish
Market, symbolical of the occupation of those who
frequent that famous mart. In Fig. 14 is seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
fabled dragon of the City of London, and in Fig. 15
the copper cock vane, one of the four fixed over
Smithfield Market.</p>

<p>There are many ecclesiastical emblems visible
during a morning stroll through the streets of
London. Among those readily seen are the key vane
on St. Peter's, Cornhill, and the emblematic gridiron
on St. Lawrence's Church. On St. Michael's Church,
Queenhithe, there is a copper ship, the hull of which
holds just one bushel of grain. This vane is
interesting in that the emblem has reference to
Queenhithe, once a famous wharf, rather than to the
patron saint. The Hithe is interesting in its old
associations, in that the tolls of that wharf were given
to Queen Eleanor by Henry II as pin money, subsequent
queens of England collecting the revenue for
their personal use. The grasshopper on the Royal
Exchange is the same vane that surmounted the
more ancient building which preceded the one now
standing. The grasshopper was the crest of Sir
Thomas Gresham, by whom the first Exchange was
built in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. This vane,
also of copper, is fully 11 ft. in length, and in
miniature was reproduced as the sign of the banking
house in Lombard Street kept by Sir Thomas
Gresham.</p>


<h3>The Door Knocker.</h3>

<p>The common door knocker, essentially a piece of
metal associated to-day with utilitarian purposes, is
not without romantic associations. It has been a
much collected object; easily detached, too, for it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
said that many of the old knockers, or rappers as
they were formerly called, which a few years ago could
be bought quite cheaply from the marine store dealers,
had been surreptitiously purloined by thieves, who for
the sake of a few coppers had taken some risk even
on a dark night. Some old houses are still rich in
antiquarian door knockers, before the days of front
door bells and electric pushes more a necessity than
they are now. Their use was by no means confined
to private houses, on which they figured in a variety
of forms, but among the earlier examples are
ponderous knockers of copper and brass, once
regarded as an essential feature on the great oaken
doors of cathedrals and churches and other important
buildings. In the days when the precincts of certain
ecclesiastical edifices were sanctuary, the knocker
was the goal sought by the criminal offender who
rushed to obtain the protection of sanctuary. One
of the most famous historical knockers which has
been copied by modern founders, and is seen in
collections of so-called antiques and in use as a
modern replica on room doors in twentieth-century
houses, is the famous knocker which did service for
so many years on the Sanctuary door of Durham
Cathedral. It is a relic of great antiquity, having
been placed on the door prior to the reign of King
Stephen. Detailing its use as sanctuary a contemporary
monk wrote: "Hereupon their leader
violently and repeatedly struck the brass rings which
hang outside the door." According to the "rights"
of Durham all the churchyard and all the circuit
thereof was sanctuary for all manner of men whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
their offences had been. It will be remembered that
in olden time, still perpetuated by its name, there
was sanctuary just outside the Abbey of Westminster,
the right being retained even after the
dissolution of the monasteries in 1540. There were
similar places of refuge for criminals at the Minories,
Whitefriars, and the old Mint in Southwark. The
Durham knocker, around which some interest centres,
was in the form of an animal's head, in which are now
two empty eye-sockets, behind which it is said lights
were placed, although it is probable that they may
have been filled with crystal balls.</p>

<p>The brass lion knocker of Brazenose College,
Oxford, has won some notoriety, and has been
much copied. The legends regarding its ancient
association with the College, and the migration of
the students to Stamford in 1334, and the subsequent
return of the knocker to Oxford after it had been
in other hands for many years, vary, and are not
altogether borne out by proven facts. The brass-nosed
knocker does not appear to have given the
name to the College, notwithstanding the very generally
accepted belief. Indeed, according to several
authorities the name originated in the words
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bracinum</i>, malt, and <em>house</em>, a brew-house having been
incorporated in the older buildings. The old
knocker, however, is still regarded as historic.</p>

<p>Few collectors of old copper and brass can hope
to possess such historical relics, nor yet are they
likely to secure any of the massive knockers, some of
which are to be seen in the Victoria and Albert
Museum at South Kensington. They can, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
readily obtain brass knockers dating from the reign
of Queen Anne, and especially the ornate knockers
of Georgian times, many of them bearing traces of
the Adams' style and of Chippendale influence.
Some knockers are peculiar in that the design is not
always apparent. In Fig. 16 is shown a fine
knocker of the much favoured armorial style, and in
Fig. 17 is given a drop knocker in the form of a
dolphin. Some of the knockers, repeated in great
numbers in certain districts, are essentially local, such
as a hook and worm pattern, which took its origin in
a Sussex village. It was the invention of a local
smith, an admirer of Izaac Walton, who it is said
frequently passed his smithy door on his way to
a fishing stream. Technically described by a
fisherman, this knocker is said to be "a lobworm of
buxom proportions dangling from a hook." There
are others, equally interesting examples, to be met
with in out-of-the-way places. One of the advantages
of collecting these common objects in brass
and other metals is that they can still be made to
serve a useful purpose on room doors, although the
rat-tat of the larger specimens is sometimes startling.</p>

<h3>Interior Metal-Work.</h3>

<p>The collectable brasses (other than domestic
kitchen brass and copper-work which is dealt with
in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>) belonging to the later period of
art, and chiefly associated with the builder's furnishing
and cabinetmaker's craft, include quite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
variety of interesting objects. In the days before
Victorian times, when art almost died out, the
coppersmith and the brazier produced some beautiful
objects for the ornamentation and furnishing of
the home, many of which have been handed down
to us, and form valuable additions to a collection of
metal. This period, as it has been already intimated,
has been very much copied, especially just
before the artists of the later Edwardian days struck
out new lines and founded a school which has been
called that of the "nouvre art." Now and then there
have been attempts to blend the old with the new,
and the collector of the genuine antique desiring
purity of style in his specimens should not neglect
any opportunities he may have of examining and
comparing the various styles. The arrangements for
lighting and heating houses were until quite recently
inefficient. There was, however, still greater neglect
in providing for the comfort of the attenders at
churches, which were frequently cold and chilly.
Attempts were made by individuals to remedy
this, and among the curios associated with heating
purposes are hand-warmers and foot-warmers. The
earlier types of hand-warmers, or chaufferettes, were
spherical metal boxes or balls, in the interior of
which, by an arrangement of chains or rings, a
cup containing a red-hot ball of metal or a piece
of charcoal could be retained in an upright position.
These portable warming stoves were also used in
many houses and on many occasions. Reference
is made to such warmers in <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">Chapter XV</a>, where a
Dutch foot-warmer is illustrated. It is said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
it was a common practice years ago for a servant
man or maid to follow a lady when attending church,
carrying a charcoal burner and placing it upon the
floor at the lady's feet, then gracefully retiring into
some less conspicuous part of the building until the
service was over. In the days when streets were
badly lighted lanterns were commonly hung outside
houses and in entrance halls, some reference
to the more portable types being given in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX</a>.</p>

<p>The metal-work of the interior, such as lock plates,
hinges, and door knobs, was frequently of brass, and
very ornate some of these quaint old fittings are.
Perhaps the most interesting are those which were
much used on the more portable sideboards, corner
cupboards, and chests. It would appear that the
extravagance in design reached its height when
Chippendale's influence extended to the metal
ornaments on the furniture, as well as to the scrollwork
and carving of the woodwork. Some of this
metal-work gives evidence of Chinese influence, or
as it was then called, Chinese taste, shown in the
introduction of the mandarin and the fakir, Oriental
landscapes, palanquins, and Chinese trees and flowers,
even in English metal-work. The collector of such
things finds a wealth of brass in even escutcheons
and handle plates (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chapter XIX</a>).</p>

<p>There is some very rich brasswork in the frames
of the old banner screens, made of beautiful needlework
panels, over which so much time must have
been spent. A remarkably fine banner holder in the
Victoria and Albert Museum is typical of many others.
We have only to look round the house and imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
how it looked a century ago to discover that the
collectable objects of copper and brass, even when
domestic utensils and curios have been removed,
included many other objects besides those referred
to which may be secured by careful and persistent
search among the old shops and builders' odds and
ends.</p>

brasses.</p>


<p>The admirer of metal-work finds examples of the
early brassworker's art in ecclesiastical edifices.
Although in years gone by there has been spoiliation
in many churches, and some of the most
valued objects in sacred buildings have been taken
for secular uses, there are still many treasured relics
which are almost unique specimens of the metal-worker's
art. It is a wonder so much has been preserved,
for too enthusiastic authorities have often
displaced the old and substituted newer objects of
no antiquarian value. In the past in restoration
work much that would have now been venerated
as antique has been destroyed. The collector
cannot be advised to bring pressure to bear on
the ecclesiastical authorities in order that he may
obtain such curios for his museum. Oftentimes
the brasses in themselves would present no special
interest. It is rather in their associations that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
antiquary sees much to admire, and to strip brasses
from the wall or memorial tablets from tombs is
vandalism and sacrilege which cannot be encouraged.
There is, however, a peculiar beauty in the metal-work
which may be seen and admired in old
churches, and the massive grandeur of grilles,
railings, and gallery fronts add to the beauty of
such buildings as a whole. In addition to these
architectural brasses there are many portable
antiques, ornate and historical.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical brasses may be divided into two
groups. First, there are those which have been
consecrated to religious purposes, including the
sacred vessels of the altar and the metal symbols
used in Divine worship, and then there are the metal
objects which serve the purpose of ornament and to
some extent utility. Among the more decorative
pieces of the first group are processional crosses,
many of which are very beautiful, in some cases
being ornamented with precious stones and enamels.
Then there are the crosses on the altar, if anything
still more decorative, for in fashioning them, especially
for use in connection with the old Gothic
cathedrals and churches in this country and on the
Continent in medi√¶val days, the artists concentrated
their best endeavours to produce metal-work worthy
of the sacred purpose for which it was to be used.
Some of the bishops' and archbishops' crooks in the
earlier days were made of ivory; then metal-work,
richly chased and jewelled, came into vogue, and
latterly some of the crooks are fine examples of the
metal-workers' art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<h3>Candlesticks.</h3>

<p>The ornaments of the altar in Christian churches
are for the most part simple in design. There are,
however, many varieties of candlesticks, varying in
size and degree from the larger ones which hold the
Communion candles to the decorative seven-branched
candelabra of light and tasteful design. The more
important specimens are the massive candlesticks
which are used in the chancel and in some of the
larger cathedrals in other parts of the building.
Such ecclesiastical bronzes are seldom obtainable,
although there are some fine examples in the
Victoria and Albert Museum in this country, and
in the chief Continental museums. The donors of
such objects spared no expense, and the modellers
and founders treated such work very elaborately.
Flemish and Spanish churches are especially rich
in large candlesticks, and many of the Continental
cathedrals possess wonderful examples. The prominence
which has been given to candlesticks in
public worship dates back to a period long before
the foundation of the Christian Church, for the
seven-branched candlestick was an important feature
in the Jewish ceremonial. When the Roman conquerors
took possession of Jerusalem, among the
treasures taken from the Temple on the sack of
the city, they carried away the golden candlesticks
from the altar. So important was this sacred trophy
that it was represented on the triumphal arch of
Titus, preserving to the artists of the future its
general characteristics of design.</p>

<p>The great bronze candlesticks in St Paul's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Cathedral and in other English churches are to be
admired but not collected; nevertheless there are
some fine candlesticks in bronze and of polished
brass offered for sale in the curio shops, and from
time to time brought under the hammer in the
London auction rooms. The illustration given in
Fig. 19 is a remarkable example which may be
seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. A fine
Venetian bronze candelabrum (one of a pair), now in
a private collection, is shown in Fig. 20.</p>


<h3>Altar Brasses.</h3>

<p>Most of the church plate so-called was of pewter
and silver in early times; in more modern days of
silver, and sometimes of metal plated with silver.
There are, however, examples of metal chalices of
bronze, some of which have been found in Ireland.
The altar brasses in pre-Reformation days included
brass censers and incense vessels, very interesting examples
of which are now in the Victoria and Albert
Museum, being illustrated in Fig. 21. Of vases and
other decorative altar brasses there are many. Some,
probably, took their origin in older customs and were
symbolical; the vases nowadays are for the most
part used as receptacles for flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="268" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="f75">FIG. 20.&mdash;VENETIAN CANDELABRUM (ONE OF A PAIR).</span></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span></p>

<p>Bordering on the secular vessels, yet associated
with the altar, there are the alms-dishes, of which
there are a great number in private collections of
metal. They are mostly of brass, some quite plain,
others engraved and highly ornamental. Some little
time ago there was a special display of alms-dishes,
two-score or more in number, exhibited at the Kelvingrove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Exhibition at Glasgow. Some were covered
over with scriptural pictorial designs, among the
favourite being those illustrating the old story of
Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden; the episode
of Samson and the lion; and the visit of the two
spies to the Promised Land, returning carrying a
large bunch of grapes. Such alms-dishes vary in
size, seldom less than 12 in. in diameter, but ranging
up to 20 in. Sometimes the collector is puzzled to
find what he may regard as inappropriate mottoes
on church vessels. On the other hand, it is not an
uncommon thing to meet with religious devices or
pious mottoes on platters and bowls which were
obviously used as domestic vessels. This fact is
explained in that at one time there was but little
difference between secular and ecclesiastical plate,
and the vessels were often used indiscriminately
for church purposes and for the use of the household.</p>


<h3>Metal Architectural Ornament.</h3>

<p>The lectern is frequently of bronze or brass. The
eagle with spread wings or other designs adopted by
the metal-workers gave the artist plenty of scope.
The altar rail and in a few instances the metal screen
and grille are composed of elaborately chased brass
or copper-work, sometimes cast, at others hammered.
Perhaps one of the greatest achievements of the
coppersmith in connection with church metal-work
is the ball and cross of St. Paul's, surmounting the
great dome. It was made in the year 1821 by
Benham and Froud, an old firm of coppersmiths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
An illustration of this gigantic piece of work is
given in Fig. 22. When viewed from beneath few
would imagine that the cross, although so high up,
is 30 ft. in height, and that its weight is upwards
of one and a half tons. The occasional gilding of
this triumph of the coppersmith's art is in itself a
costly procedure.</p>


<h3>Memorial Brasses.</h3>

<p>The visitor to the country church, as well as
the larger cathedral, finds much antiquarian interest
in the tombs and monuments, and in the memorial
tablets of the illustrious dead the history of their
lives may often be read. In the older tombs the
work of the sculptors in marble is frequently enriched
by the addition of appropriate tablets of brass, sometimes
inlaid with enamels. One of the most noted
tombs is that in the centre of the chapel of
Henry VII. in Westminster Abbey, the tomb itself
being closely guarded by the massive railings, which
are of brass. The visitor to that chapel notes with
interest the brass stall plates so rich in enamels, on
which are the arms and crests of the knights who
in times past occupied those stalls and hung their
banners over them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="f75">FIG. 21.&mdash;BRONZE INCENSE BURNER AND INCENSE BOAT.</span><br />
(<em>In the Victoria and Albert Museum.</em>)</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span></p>


<p>It may be contended that tombs and monuments
cannot be collected, but those who visit such places
may fill their notebooks with interesting data, and
they may carry away with them accurate records
and rubbings of the monumental tablets and the
brasses on the tombs (for instructions how to take
rubbings, see Wrinkles, <a href="#Page_393">p. 393</a>). Such rubbings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
old brasses can be kept in a portfolio or mounted
and hung upon walls. They form a record, too, of
the engraver's art, which was modified and altered
to suit the change which went on in architectural
design and to some extent in social and religious
customs. The variety of brasses is seen when a
good collection of rubbings is classified and arranged
according to style, period, or locality. Some districts
yield prolific returns. Throughout the counties
of Gloucester, Somerset, and Norfolk many may
be obtained, the more interesting specimens being
secured from tombs dating from the thirteenth
to the seventeenth century. From such a series
armorial representation as it became less real and of
smaller importance can be traced. The costumes
of the period, too, are very clearly shown, for in such
a collection of brasses the value of armour in war is
seen to change. In the earlier examples there is the
chain mail of the cross-legged knights as seen on
the early brasses of the Crusaders, the medi√¶val
armour of the Middle Ages when it had reached its
strength, and the brasses of the Stuart days when
the ornamental armour of that period had to a large
extent lost its utility.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical brasses on the tombs of bishops
and other church dignitaries show the change which
took place very gradually in the vestments worn,
and indicate the alteration in ecclesiastical ritual
in the cathedrals and churches at the time of
the Reformation. The dissolution of the monasteries
and the sacrilege which took place in the
dismantled churches and religious houses caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
valuable relics to be sold for old metal, and it was
then that many old monuments and tombs lost their
brasses. The influence of book knowledge and the
change which came about in the style of script after
the introduction of the printing-press is seen in the
evolution of the lettering on church brasses. Indeed,
in some of the older ones the form of the letters
is the only indication left of the date of their
engraving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span></p>

<p>The engraver's art progressed with the art of the
period in which he lived, and in a collection of rubbings
may be seen the gradual training of the eye
and hand until from meaningless pictures without
background or perspective the artist was able to
engrave on metal a beautifully realistic picture of
the subject he had chosen. As a guide to a few
indications of the period to which brasses belong,
it may be mentioned that the decorative canopies
on monumental brasses belong chiefly to the ornate
period of art. The embattled canopies and the
change to the decorative Gothic tell of the progress
in ecclesiastical architecture until it reached its
height between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
later brasses telling of its gradual decadence.
Of the variety of subject it would be impossible
to refer, for at all ages there have been many
who would fit into niches between the extremes
of the early fighting men amidst the nobles
and knights who fell in battle, and those who
apparently lived all their lives in the peaceful
rural surroundings of some quiet English village,
dying within sight of the old church where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
had worshipped, and where they were eventually
buried.</p>

<p>A collection of metal-work representative of
domestic utensils as they were fashioned in very
early times, and as they were made in days so far
forgotten as to render the common objects of daily
use curios, is regarded, probably, as the most important
branch of copper and brass, from a collector's
standpoint. The collector may be content with
gathering together a few examples of old domestic
metal-work and using them as ornamental reminders
of olden time, decorating his entrance hall or rooms
furnished after the antique with the objects he
gathers together, or he may arrange them as in a
museum gallery. The display of curios is at all
times a matter of taste, but it is one of some importance,
especially in a branch of collecting so conspicuous
as copper and brass. We can scarcely
conceive of any real pleasure being derived from such
a hobby, or of such specimens being appreciated by
one's friends, when specimens so obviously out of place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
are shown in a modern dining-room or drawing-room
furnished in nouvre art. The Keeper of the London
Museum, now transferred to Stafford House from
Kensington Palace, has very appropriately arranged
the antiquities of London in their proper historical
and chronological sequence, and has grouped them
so that the reference they bear to contemporary
surroundings can be understood by those who see
them for the first time. The photograph which we
reproduce in Fig. 23 represents a corner in a well
made up seventeenth-century room, in which has
been gathered together some beautiful old oak furniture
of that period. It is panelled with oak which
has been procured from old London houses of contemporary
date; the doorway is a genuine antique
from Bromley-by-Bow, adding to the appearance
of the room, for its hinges and lock furniture are
splendid examples of the brasswork of that period.
Some pieces of Cromwellian armour, prominent
among which are variously ornamented helmets and
breastplates, are arranged round the upper portion of
the room. Over an old oak chest is a beautiful brass
skimmer, and on the wall a seventeenth-century
brass bed-warmer, with engraved cover. On the sideboard
is a huge key and a brass mortar. The lock
furniture and the drop handle on the sideboard,
which are of brass, are worthy of note. On the
other side of the room there is a fine brass trivet
standing in front of the hearth, on which are andirons,
and logs ready for the firing; close by is a
quaint old candlestick. Undoubtedly curios displayed
in such a way interest and instruct those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
see them, and a room so furnished enthuses collectors
with the desire to secure other objects of an
appropriate character; this in itself is an advantage
in that a representative collection is of more general
interest than one containing many objects of a
similar character.</p>

<h3>The Kitchen.</h3>

<p>Kitchen utensils and domestic appliances which
the housewife of olden time deemed necessary are
of peculiar interest in that they help us to recall
the habits and customs of former generations. It
is not always easy to arrange a model kitchen in
that there are many old utensils of copper and brass
which must have been used side by side as periods
overlapped, although some have a much older origin
than others. It is said that the kitchens of well-stocked
old family mansions still yield some curios
when thoroughly examined, and that it is not at
all an uncommon thing to find there utensils the
object of which has almost been forgotten. They
are relics of an older day, and utensils which a
modern cook would not deign to use. Such discoveries,
however, are few and far between, for the
melting-pot and the cupidity of those anxious to
clear unnecessary encumbrances and perhaps make
a little towards refurnishing, has left but few objects
of interest in the kitchen. It is, however, there and
in the old houseplace that we may look for something
of interest. Some will go on using old vessels
long after newer utensils have taken their place in
the more advanced households, and there are some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
cooks who use successfully saucepans and kettles of
almost antique pattern which the student of the
cook's art in the modern schools of cookery would
find difficult to manipulate. They have been taught
how to make tasty dishes with aluminium vessels
and enamelled pans, whereas heavy and clumsy brass
and copper utensils served their grandparents. The
cook's art is appreciated to-day as it was in the past,
and at all periods the domestic workshop has been
surrounded with a halo of romance. Shakespeare
has rendered the caldron of olden time memorable
in "Macbeth." Of the caldron boiling in the dark
cave he makes the witches cry:</p>

<p>The cooking-pot is the sustainer of life, in that it
gives strength to the weary and to the starving.
To the poor dumb creatures, however, it is the end
of life, and in savagery human life has been sacrificed
to the gluttony of fellow-men. Wonderful stories
are at times told of great feasts and of the magnificence
of the kitchens of olden time, where the
vessels and the cooking-pots were of extravagant
size, making up, perhaps, for the fewer culinary
utensils, for in early days the furnishings of the
kitchen were few in number although massive and
strong. Many of the baronial halls of the Middle
Ages, and the homes of wealthy landowners in more
recent days, have been the scene of great feasts.
Merrie England rejoiced on such occasions when
the roasting-jack and the spit contributed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
success of the feast, and the caldron or cooking-pot
boiled upon the open hearth. In some old kitchens
there are preserved ponderous bronze and copper
pots, some so large that we can scarcely imagine
that they were made for actual use. In the hall of
Trinity Hospital at Leicester there is preserved a
large caldron of bell metal, holding upwards of sixty
gallons, which has been used as the cooking-pot of
the institution from its foundation until quite recent
times. This quaint old relic, now venerated as a
curio, is locally called the Duke of Lancaster's
porridge-pot, for it is said that it was made to the
order of Henry, Duke of Lancaster, in 1331 (see
Fig. 24). Not far removed from the corner where
the old metal pot is shown to visitors there is a
massive nutmeg-grater, a kitchen relic of olden time,
which on the occasion of one of her visits to Leicester
Queen Elizabeth presented to the hospital. Many
old castles have relics of the feast to show visitors,
and others no doubt could produce equally interesting
examples of the coppersmiths' or the founders'
art were they to search the vaults and cellars where
disused metal-work was in years gone by stowed away.
Visitors to Warwick Castle are familiar with "Guy's
punchbowl," the remarkable metal caldron which is
nearly twice the size of that attributed to the Duke
of Lancaster, for it weighs, along with a fork said
to have been used to handle the meat, 807 lb.</p>

<p>Most of these old vessels were cast, but some
copper-work was hammered by hand, and those
which have been preserved to us testify to the
brawny arm of the smith and the strength of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
blow when by hammer and hand he wrought them.
Such copper caldrons were often made in two or
more parts, and having been shaped on the block,
were afterwards riveted together. It is puzzling at
times to understand local and trade terms in that
they frequently differ from the commonly accepted
names of cooking vessels. Thus, these wrought
caldrons or pots were frequently designated tripod
kettles. A very fine example of such a wrought
copper kettle was recovered a short time ago from
Whittlesey Mere and is now in the Peterborough
Museum. A century or more ago the Mere was
famous in Huntingdonshire and many water parties
were held there. The kettle recently found is
thought to have been a relic of those events, and
to have been used on the margin of the lake.</p>

<p>The fine caldron of cast brass illustrated in Fig. 27
was found during excavations in Water Lane, in
London. It is peculiar in that it has two-eared
handles and projecting feet. It is very substantial,
and may be regarded as typical of the early metal
caldrons, several of which have been found in
London. Another cooking vessel, smaller in size,
having a curved handle and being in good preservation,
a domestic relic of the seventeenth century,
which was dug up in Milton Street, Cripplegate, is
illustrated in Fig. 28.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span></p>

<p>Reference has been made to the baronial halls,
and to the numerous relics which have been lost
to futurity. There are, however, some well-known
castles where, although the kitchens have been
replenished from time to time, the older forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
cooking vessels have been perpetuated. Until recent
days the kitchen arrangements at Windsor Castle
remained much as they had been for many years
previous, and even now copper and brass retain a
favoured position and are very much in evidence.
Windsor has been the scene of much feasting, and
many great State events have put a strain even
upon the domestic resources of that famous Royal
residence.</p>

<p>The great kitchen of the castle is supplemented by
a vegetable kitchen, a green kitchen, and a scullery,
and around these rooms there is a bright array of
copper pans and cooking utensils, mostly bearing the
monogram of George IV, for it was in his reign that
many new culinary appointments were added. These
vessels, large and small, were in constant use during
the reign of Queen Victoria. Her late Majesty was
averse to change. In her days oak out of Windsor
Forest was burned in the grate, and the spits and
roasting-jacks and other kitchen accessories were in
keeping with the copper and brass pans and kettles.
Great changes have been made since the accession of
George V, for Queen Mary supervises the management
of the Royal kitchens, and many modern
cooking vessels have been substituted for older
ones.</p>

<p>The collector of copper and brass culinary utensils
has seldom an opportunity of adding the large
bronze caldrons and relics of Royal kitchens to his
collection. He has to be content with exploring
lesser domains, and securing wherever possible the
smaller cooking vessels of days gone by. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
are frequently quite as interesting as those of
larger size, and there is a wealth of copper still
lying dormant in antique shops, and in some
instances in the scrap-heaps of the old metal
dealer. Without going any further back the
saucepans of the seventeenth century well reward
the discoverer of such relics. That century was a
time when pious mottoes were carved upon the
lintel beam and when old coffers and other pieces
of massive oak were decorated with such sentiments.
The brassfounders followed suit and ornamented
pots and pans, and enriched them with
mottoes just as they cast such inscriptions on
bells and mortars. Two very interesting seventeenth-century
vessels are illustrated on p. 165. One
of these, Fig. 25, was discovered some years ago in
Fetter Lane, and is now in the Guildhall Museum.
The other, Fig. 26, is a tripod pot, the handle of
which has a loop near the bowl. It is probably
of early seventeenth or late sixteenth-century
workmanship. The brass skillet of seventeenth-century
make, illustrated in Fig. 29, may be seen
by the curious in the British Museum. There is
no uncertainty about its date, for it is marked
1684, and along the handle is the quaint motto
"Pitty the Pore." Collectors may be reminded that
inscriptions are sometimes stamped; at others engraved,
and they are frequently met with on quite
unimportant vessels. The metal used for such
utensils was chiefly of brass, but often of latten, an
alloy in which there was an admixture of zinc, or
of tin in what was known as white latten. As it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
has been stated already, brass came into vogue late
in the sixteenth century, and soon became popular
for kitchen utensils; latten, however, was a favourite
alloy for spoons and the smaller objects, especially
for porringers for mulling wine. Concurrent with
the use of copper and its modern alloys bronze
appears to have been used in this country even as
late as the beginning of the seventeenth century,
the cooking vessels illustrated in Figs. 30 and 31
being bronze of this late type.</p>

<p>The skillet, which continued a favourite vessel,
commonly called a saucepan, originally had three
short-curved feet, and the handle was curved, too.
It was a development of a still earlier cooking
vessel; its prototype of the sixteenth century having
a globular body with short-curved feet, and frequently
two handles.</p>

<p>The twentieth-century collector, accustomed as he
is to machine-and factory-made goods of uniform
finish and of regular shapes, is apt to be a little bit
disappointed with the copper curios roughly made
and badly formed. It would appear as if most of
the collectable copper goods were made after the
days when the old guilds so carefully controlled the
making of copper and latten in Lothbury. When
their power of control waned, craftsmen who had
been employed by guild members worked for themselves,
and there was but little supervision over the
metal wares made by the coppersmith, who was often
a retailer of his own wares. When the hardware
dealer or copper man became an established trader
in the eighteenth century he would employ a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
journeyman coppersmith in his little workshop, who
would fashion the utensils with a hammer on a
wooden block, and afterwards planish them by hand
as he thought fit. In the making of such goods
there was great irregularity, and the dealer and his
customer, too, were dependent upon the whim of the
craftsman. That was before the days of machine-made
goods. Instead of the brass or copper being
pressed and stamped by machinery and carefully
finished the utensils were made in a rough and
ready way on the wooden block, and simply hammered
in the rounded cavities which had been
made in it. Saucepans, stewpans, and jelly moulds
were beaten into shape, and then hollowed and
dished. It is said it was a healthful trade, for
many of the old coppersmiths had passed their
threescore years and ten shaping kettles and
deftly fashioning from a sheet of brass even quite
ornamental domestic articles of utility; they would
decorate by hand a brass chestnut roaster with no
other tools but a small hammer and a punch, and
with the same simple instruments they would work
a fancy pattern on the lid of a warming-pan.
Some coppersmiths won fame in the fashioning of
furnace-pans, better known as washing coppers,
and others would undertake the roofing of houses
and churches. One notable firm in London, whose
copper saucepans and cooking-pots had been sold for
a hundred years or more, achieved the zenith of their
fame when they produced that enormous piece of
copper-work, the ball and cross of St. Paul's Cathedral,
which is referred to and illustrated in another chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span></p>

<p>There is yet another reason given why so many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the old copper pots and pans are irregular in shape
and are often fitted with apparently unsuitable
handles. It is that most of these old vessels at one
time or another have undergone repairs, and were
frequently treated by unskilled workmen. Among
the street cries of London one of the oldest was:
"Any pots or pans to mend?" The travelling
tinker was a repairing coppersmith, too, and much
of his time was occupied in mending the copper and
brass cooking utensils used at the farmhouses and in
the villages through which he passed. His methods
of dealing with the vessels entrusted to him for repairs
were not always the best, as museum relics testify.</p>

<p>Drinking cups, tankards, and flagons constitute
another very important section of collectable curios.
They were, however, chiefly made of pewter in the
days before glass and earthenware became general.
Some were undoubtedly of copper. This metal,
however, was chiefly used for large jugs in which
water and other liquids were carried. Water vessels
vary in shape, although certain characteristics are
frequently noticeable. The typical English-made
jug and water vessel, such as those shown in Figs.
32, 33, 34, and 35, are very graceful in shape, the
handles being light and very suitable. They make
remarkably welcome additions to a collection of
metal, and are appropriate ornaments on an old oak
sideboard.</p>


<h3>The Houseplace.</h3>

<p>It is not a far remove from the kitchen to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
houseplace, and it is there that some of the more
decorative brasswork of eighteenth-century workmanship
is chiefly to be found. Just as copper and brass
formed a prominent feature in the equipment of the
kitchen, so in the old houseplace they were considered
the best for ornamental purposes. The polishing of
the metal-work throughout the house in the good old
days must have been a considerable item in the
duties of domestic servants, but no doubt it well
repaid the labour, for from the old ornaments and
usable curios of the houseplace which have come
into the hands of collectors, especially when
housed in a reconstructed eighteenth-century room,
the effect is excellent. The metal-work of the best
parlour was not so extensive, although there were
many beautifully polished coal-vases and fender frets.
Indeed, in both rooms mentioned the chief attraction
would appear to have centred on the fireplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span></p>


<p>The story of the evolution of the grate and the
hearth and its appointments is of extreme interest.
The grate itself was at times ornate with polished
brass beads and canopies. The older type of fireplace
was mostly fitted with iron appointments, but
even when andirons were upon the hearth and logs
of timber crackled as they blazed up the wide old
chimney, the dogs or chief ornaments of the hearth
were often of brass or bronze. When hob-grates and
registers came in fashion, ormolu and brass ornament
contrasted with polished steel. A typical parlour
hob-grate of the eighteenth century would be ornate
with brasses on the hobs, a pierced brass fender on
the stone slab, and a polished brass ashes pan in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of the bars to hide the cinders. The trivet or
revolving stool, small or large, was in the fender or on
the hearth, and massive fire brasses (not irons) filled
the empty spaces.</p>

<p>The brass trivet, revived in modern times, was
originally a three-legged stool made of metal, on
which a kettle or similar vessel could be placed near
to the fire. The convenience of being able to put the
trivet stool quite close up to the bars suggested to
the maker of such things the addition of hooks by
which the trivet could be hung upon the bar, thereby
bringing it nearer to the heat. In later years the
trivet developed a handle for the convenience of
moving it about, and especially of hanging it upon
the bars, and in the latest completed form with
turned wood handle, iron legs, and brass fretted top,
the trivet was regarded as an essential accompaniment
to the fire-grate. From the three-legged stool
with hooks or handle there came a minor development
in the form of a light portable trivet without
legs, which could only be used when hung on the
bars. These varieties presented the worker in brass
with an excellent opportunity of showing his decorative
skill, and brass trivet tops soon became very
ornamental. Fig. 36 represents a finely-pierced brass
trivet, with tall legs and pointed feet and a turned
wood handle. On the top of a baluster-shaped
device, supported by dolphins, Atlas is represented
bearing on his shoulders the globe. The date of the
trivet is 1668, and on the top is also engraved the
owner's monogram. Another very interesting
example comes from Derbyshire, and is shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Fig. 38. Yet another example is given in Fig. 37,
this being a more elaborate design. In the centre
of the plate an eagle is represented with outstretched
wings. The construction of this trivet is
somewhat unusual in that it is strengthened with
a cross-bar; the feet are of spear-head shape. All
three examples are to be seen at South Kensington.</p>

<p>There have been many modern replicas of the
beautiful old brass helmet-shaped coal-boxes so
common half a century ago. The earlier types
varied somewhat in shape, but always preserved
their helmet-like form, as illustrated in the example
shown in Fig. 39. In the days when these coal-boxes
were fashionable, miniature pipkins were
sold for drawing-room use, and a little later oblong
and oval boxes of polished brass and copper were
in common use; in some places the brass log
boxes taking their place, especially where wood
was plentiful.</p>

<p>It is probable no domestic utensil or appliance has
gained greater notoriety than the copper and brass
warming-pan, which so long held an honoured
place in the chimney corner. It was used nightly
in winter for warming beds in the often large and
chilly rooms, both in the homes of the wealthy and
of the middle classes. One of these pans is represented
in Fig. 23 on the wall of the seventeenth-century
room already mentioned as being on view
in the London Museum. Another very handsome
warming-pan, which is in the Victoria and Albert
Museum, is very exceptional in style. Many of the
earlier examples are dated, and sometimes engraved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
or embossed with pious or loyal sentiments,
as was the custom of the times. The Royal
Albert Memorial Museum at Exeter contains
several interesting warming-pans; one, which is
dated on the lid 1622, is engraved: "<span class="f75">I.R. GOD
SAVE KING JAMES</span>"; another, with an iron handle,
is of still earlier date, being stamped 1616 on
the lid.</p>

<p>Brass foot-warmers were at one time in regular
use; a very fine example, shown in Fig. 40, is of
octagonal shape, covered with repouss√© decoration,
and fitted with a folding bail handle, facilitating its
removal from place to place. There have been many
copper foot-warmers, carriage warmers, and the like
used in days before modern heating arrangements
were known. Some years ago little copper muff-warmers
were sold in the shops; but they were of
no great novelty, for as far back as the seventeenth
century what were known as warming boxes were
made for keeping the hands warm on journeys when
travelling by the very cold and draughty stage
coaches. These curious little boxes of brass or
copper were heated with a removable mass of iron,
which could be lifted out of the box, which hinged
in the centre, by means of an iron hook; just in the
same way the old box irons were operated. In Figs.
41 and 42 one of these early boxes, which may be
seen in the Guildhall Museum, is illustrated. Thus
in olden time the comfort of travellers was attained.
The old inns were welcome retreats after a stormy
journey by road, and the older inns of the coaching
days often contain many interesting relics of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
days when the copper and brass objects we now call
curious and old were new. Those objects referred to
in the previous paragraphs by no means exhaust the
list of houseplace curios in metal, but they may serve
to point out the great interest which attaches to even
common objects of everyday use when a few years
have passed by and changes have been brought about
in everyday usages.</p>

<h3>Chimney and other Ornaments.</h3>

<p>As it has been intimated already, the fireplace was
a centre of attraction in all old houses. It was customary
on a winter's night to draw up close to the
fire, and in so doing it was only natural that the
chimney piece and those objects which rested thereon
would be constantly looked at. This probably gave
makers the cue when designing ornamental brasswork
which could be used as household decoration.
The ornaments of those days were substantial, and
the chimney ornaments solid and lasting. It was a
common thing to see a row of brass figures or pairs
of brass ornaments on the chimney-piece. Such
designs as those shown in Figs. 43 and 44 were
popular. Our illustrations represent one only of
each fashion; the pairs, however, were usually designed
opposite hands, looking to right and left.
Such ornaments were seen on the kitchen mantelpieces
of the well-to-do and on the hob-grates of the
houseplaces of the middle classes. This was the
prevailing custom from fifty to seventy years ago,
and still earlier similar ornaments, cruder in design,
evidently modelled after the style of the Bow pottery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
figures, were in use. In Lancashire and in the
manufacturing districts of the Black Country brass
ornaments of similar and more modern types have
always been favoured, and they are still sold as
ornaments to well-to-do artisans and mechanics.
The modern castings are rougher and not so decorative
or beautifully designed as the tooled castings of
earlier days. The peacock was a favourite bird and
shared with the pheasant popularity. These designs
are easily recognizable among the genuine antiques.
There were larger animals, too, such as the horse, an
example of which is given in Fig. 45. This favourite
beast of burden was oftentimes represented as a dray
horse; in more sporting circles as a hack or a hunter.
In agricultural districts the wagoner, the huntsman,
and dogs and hounds were chiefly favoured. They
were generally set on a base or plinth, an exceptionally
good country brass of the earlier type representing
a shepherd with his typical crook. Little
statuettes represented politicians and historical and
even allegorical figures. Among the portrait brasses
Napoleon was a favourite subject in the days when
his name was familiar in every household. Izaac
Walton, the exponent of the gentle art, was often
modelled in brass, and even Robinson Crusoe and
his man Friday formed the subject of a rare group.
The Continents of America, Africa, and Asia are rare
and interesting allegorical groups. Other brasses
show traces of Chippendale influence, especially those
in miniature which represent familiar household
objects, among which are wonderful little models of
circular tables and of the oval loo tables, like those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
then seen in the best parlour. There are also miniature
brass trivets and stools and models of grandfather
chairs.</p>

<p>Brass ornaments such as those described are not
altogether confined to chimney ornaments, for on a
larger scale they were frequently used on the old hob-grates,
the polished brass or copper contrasting with
the shining blacklead put on with plenty of elbow
grease. They were used, too, as door porters and
also as sideboard ornaments. The ornaments of the
early nineteenth century in metal were, however,
almost entirely associated with utilitarian purposes,
the artist decorating the commoner objects, giving
special attention to the repouss√© work and engraving
on those portions which would be in view when the
dustpan, warming-pan, hearth brush, or other object
was hung up.</p>


<h3>Classified Arrangement.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span></p>

<p>In addition to those articles mentioned in the foregoing
paragraphs there are many domestic utensils
highly decorative, such as candlesticks and lighting
apparatus, referred to in other chapters in this volume.
These all come under the special notice of the collector
of copper and brasswork who turns his attention
to domestic antiques. Such collectable objects
as already suggested should be arranged in a room
furnished in similar style to that prevailing at a time
when these metal curios were in daily use. If such
a room is not available an alternative method is to
arrange the domestic curios so that by comparison
the progress made by makers as each succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
generation came and went can be seen and appreciated.
Incidentally that method is very interesting
in that it reveals the periods at which art was uppermost,
and indicates those times when the utility of
domestic copper and brass was in the ascendant
rather than their ornate appearance. Popular taste
was followed by the maker at all times, and the more
progressive manufacturers were ever on the look-out
for some slight improvement either in design or
decoration&mdash;seldom, however, making any radical
change&mdash;so that the progress in metal-work was one
of development slowly unfolded.</p>

<p>Artificial light and heat were among the first
scientific discoveries of primeval man. To harness
the forces of Nature was undoubtedly a great
achievement, and at first would be viewed with
alarm. The fire which had been kindled from
natural causes would be looked upon with awe by
the cave men or the dwellers in the forest. When
they saw it dying down they would very naturally
make some effort to keep the fire burning by adding
fresh fuel. The time would come, however, when
lighting a fire by artificial means would be resorted
to; and the methods adopted in those far-off
days involved the use of primitive contrivances,
some of which are described on the next page.
The fire burning under the camp kettle would in
course of time suggest a flaming torch, which could
be carried about at will; and from the torch, which
burned all too quickly, came the discovery of oil
lamps and the candle. At first this was only a rushlight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
used side by side with the cresset torch; and
then in later days came lamps and lanterns.</p>


<h3>Fire-making Apparatus.</h3>

<p>The collector of copper and brass looks with regret
on the early fire-making apparatus in that iron was
the chief metal employed. Nevertheless there are
some objects associated with fire-making manufactured
in brass. There are some well-known collectors
who have specialized on fire-making appliances and
early lamps. Among fire-making appliances are
those of the percussion type, commencing with iron
pyrites, flint, steel, and tinder. Some of the earlier
tinder boxes were made of brass, although the
majority were of wood and tin; many of the pistol-action
tinder boxes which immediately followed the
earlier form were furnished with stands and candle-sockets,
being used for the purpose of lighting an
early candle. Some of the brass candle-stands and
candle-sockets are beautifully engraved, and many of
the contrivances which were fired by the priming of
gunpowder, the flash igniting the tinder, are highly
ornamental. That method, of course, marked an
advance. There are pistol-action tinder boxes from
Japan, highly ornamental, the cases being pierced and
in some instances decorated with raised silver and
copper relief. From China and Central Asia come
tinder pouches, many of them having decorative brass
mounts, some being gilt on copper. Tinder was often
carried about in tubes of brass and copper, some of
the best examples being very elaborately engraved.
In some small compartments are found; these were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
intended for the flint and steel. A later type of
mechanical fire-making appliance, introduced by
Richard Lorentz, in 1807, took the form of a
patented compression tube or fire syringe, the piston
of which was of brass. Chemical methods of lighting
fires and striking lights have been tried with more or
less success, and among the collectable curios are
relics of these early attempts to produce fire and light
by scientific methods. The collector, while welcoming
every curious object, has generally to rely upon the
objects which were in common use and made in
larger quantities. Of these commonly used appliances,
however, there are many varieties, and of the
more perfected forms of lighting requisites there is
an abundant choice.</p>

<h3>Candles and Candlesticks.</h3>

<p>Many are the legends and stories of the days when
the flickering light of a candle threw shadows across
the ceiling and partly lighted and partly obscured the
table and floor. Ghostly, too, they seemed as the
embers of the fire died on the hearth. The provision
of artificial light for use during the long winter evenings
has always been one of the domestic cares, and
the women of the household were in early days
mindful of the coming winter during the summer and
autumn months. Among their domestic duties was
that of gathering and drying rushes and dipping them
in fat. The primitive rushlights gave an uncertain
glimmer, and the moulding of candles with cotton
wicks would be welcomed as an advance. Candles
were home-made until comparatively modern times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and the candle mould was an essential in every
household. It was frequently of brass, and varied in
size and in the number of moulds, the one shown in
Fig. 46 having only two tubes. While the custom of
making candles at home continued long in country
districts, in towns candle-making became a trade,
and, as was the custom in those days, the moulders
of candles assembled together in certain well-known
thoroughfares. In London, Candlewick Street, the
name of which has since been corrupted into Cannon
Street, was their rendezvous.</p>

<p>The store of candles for immediate use was kept
close at hand in the candle box, placed against the
wall in some convenient position. The boxes were
of wood and japanned tin; others were of brass,
some being very ornamental and covered over with
engravings. Such candle boxes are to be found in
the curio shops; several fine examples may frequently
be seen near St. James's Park Station in London,
where there are several curio dealers who specialize on
old copper and brass, the neighbourhood being quite
a happy hunting ground for the collector of metal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="f75">FIG. 48.&mdash;CANDELABRUM OF EARLY TYPE (CENTRAL FIGURE), AND TWO OIL LAMPS.</span><br />
(<em>In Washington Museum.</em>)</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span></p>

<p>The evolution of the candlestick was slow at first.
The old rushlight-holders were made by the country
smith, and very clumsy they were on their heavy
wooden stands. The first idea seems to have been
to stick the candle on a spike, oftentimes such spikes
being placed conveniently on the wall. Then came
the "sticks" on stands which could be moved about
the room, in some cases with a sliding holder, the
height of which could be regulated. Gradually,
however, the candlestick for table use and the candlestick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with the dished base, which became common as
the type of the chamber candlestick, came into being.
With the progress made and the general acceptance
of the two types, the pillar candlestick and the
chamber candlestick, the artist in metal began to
turn his attention to perfecting their forms and
decorating them.</p>

<p>Many remarkable candlesticks in bronze are met
with among ecclesiastical brasses, some of which are
referred to in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>. Of the domestic candlesticks
there are many early examples, some with
beautifully twisted columns and later fluted examples.
The pricket candlestick&mdash;that is, a candlestick with a
spike on which a candle was firmly placed&mdash;eventually
gave way to the more convenient socket, and a flange
at the top of the column held any candle grease which
might run down the sides of the candle. The pricket
candlesticks of early twelfth-century make illustrated
in Fig. 47 may be referred to as examples of the
pricket form, their chief attractions being found in
the richly enamelled decoration. In Fig. 48 we are
able to illustrate a very interesting candelabrum now
in the National Museum at Washington City. It is
made up literally of two candlesticks attached to a
very simple pillar bracket on which they slide up
and down, the addition of a metal reflector suggesting
later developments in candlesticks and lamps. In
the later days both brass and silver candlesticks,
especially the tall lights used on mantelpiece or on
sideboard, were ornamented in keeping with the plate
of the period, and were eventually classed among the
more decorative appointments of the home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>When candles were made of tallow the wicks
burned black and charred and a constant snuffing
was necessary. This brought about the use of
snuffers of polished steel and of brass, and a little
later of snuffer trays, the snuffers and their accompanying
trays forming a most interesting addition to the
collection of metal. Candlesticks are still used, but
the candles are of superior quality and burn steady
and bright. Some are very decorative, too, especially
the painted candlesticks which with their ornamental
shades are attached to pianos, and are used as wall
lights or as additional lights upon the table. The
days of brass candlesticks, snuffers, and trays have,
however, long been numbered, and most of these
relics of old-world lights have passed into the region
of curios. Here and there they may be seen in their
once accustomed place, but more as ornament than
for actual use. In a well-known hotel, at one time
an old coaching house famous for its copper and
brass wares, the candlesticks in those early days a
necessity are now placed in pairs on the bedroom
mantelpieces as mementoes of the past. They are
not intended for use, for the electric switch is at hand,
and the newer light has taken the place of the wax
candle (see <a href="#Page_205">Fig. 49</a>).</p>

<h3>Oil Lamps and Lanterns.</h3>

<p>Much might be written of oil lamps and lanterns,
of which there are many interesting curios. They
are varied, too, for they cover a large field reaching
from almost prehistoric times to the present day.
Many lamps of metal and bronze have survived and
are found in our museums side by side with the still
earlier examples of terra-cotta and crude pottery.
There is a very interesting collection of early lamps
in the Guildhall Museum, one of the most attractive
examples being a Roman lamp of bronze, a portion
of the central oil space being covered. The bronze
lamp illustrated in Fig. 50 which may be seen in the
London Museum, is claimed by the authorities to be
unique in London finds, and is probably the finest
example of a Roman lamp discovered in England.
The collector finds his most interesting examples in
lamps which have been made in this country the outcome
of the candle and of the candle lamp which
was gradually evolved. Many of these early candle
lamps were adaptations of old candlesticks; it would
appear that the idea of enclosing a candle in a horn
lantern and thereby securing greater steadiness on
account of its being protected from the wind and
draughts, which had already been adopted, suggested
a glass cup or protection to the candle on the table.
It is quite likely that the first experiments were
made with a broken cup of porcelain with the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
knocked out, for the earliest examples seem to have
taken that form, the cup-like vessels being gradually
confined more and more at the top and the bottom.
The idea of a candle-clock occurred to seventeenth-century
candlestick makers, who marked the edges
of the lamp on the framework so that as the candles
burned low they marked the hours. The burning
would be more or less irregular, but the marks on the
candle-clocks would be some guide, and served their
purpose in days when the time of day was of less
moment than it is now.</p>

<p>Oil, which had early been the chief lighting medium,
was once more in the ascendant when in the
eighteenth century oil lamps gradually took the
place of candles. Fig. 48 represents a handsome
pair of old oil lamps, their beautifully shaped vase
containers being reminiscent of the urns and vases
at that time ornamenting the mahogany sideboard.
It is said that many such lamps were made in
England and sent over to America before the War
of Independence, and that in the homesteads of the
old plantations such relics have been treasured.
The examples shown in the accompanying illustrations
are now in the United States National
Museum at Washington.</p>

<p>In the days when the watchman called the time of
the night street-lighting was unknown. Lanterns
were carried in the hand and the links-boys were in
attendance.</p>

<p>In Fig 51 is shown a brass lantern (open and

Public Libraries and Art Gallery Committee, a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
interesting specimen of an eighteenth-century collapsible
lantern of brass and horn. It measures
6&frac14; in. high and is 3-3/8 in. square. Such lanterns were
very common in the eighteenth century, and indeed
in still more recent times in country places where
they were very necessary before country roads were
improved and rural thoroughfares lighted.</p>

<p>We must, however, fain pass over street-lighting
for the lanterns which have been copied so many times
in more recent days. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Apropos</i> of lanterns of copper

<p>The metal of which bells are made differs only
from that used for other copper wares in its alloy.
The ancients, however, made many mysteries about
the constituents of the metal by which they were able
to produce such beautiful notes and musical sounds.
The modern bellfounder uses about 75 parts of
copper and 25 parts of tin, varying it sometimes
by a mixture of zinc and lead, and in that he differs
little from the bellfounder of old, except that the
older craftsman made a secret of his alloy and sometimes
added a small quantity of other metals. The
theory is that a large percentage of copper gives
a deep tone, whereas the greater addition of zinc
and tin gives a sharper ring.</p>


<h3>The Founders' Secrets.</h3>

<p>A knowledge of metals and of their qualities is a
desirable accomplishment which all metal-workers
and founders should possess, and it was doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
because some of the early bellfounders intuitively, or
as the result of accidental experiment, discovered the
true properties of the alloys they used that they were
able to excel in the craft. There are secrets associated
with the mixing of the metal, too, especially that
of heating the molten metal to the correct temperature
at the most critical moment of running it into the
mould. Much depends also upon tuning the bells
by turning and reducing their thicknesses at the right
place in the bell's cone. The accuracy of such details
is essential, otherwise those mellow sounds for which
many of the old bells are noted would be absent. It
is true that the rich mellowness and musical notes
so noticeable in some peals are due to some extent to
age, the exact influence of which is not fully understood.
The bellfounder has always regarded his
work from a lofty standard, and has recorded the
accomplishment of any great work by the inscriptions
he has caused to be cast upon the surface of the
bell. Such data is often accompanied by the name
and trademark of the founder, the Bellfounders'
arms being frequently added. Sometimes such
inscriptions are dated; at others the lettering is
sufficient to denote the date of the work.</p>

<p>The making of great bells was always regarded as
an event of some importance. Most of those which
have obtained historic fame have either been
associated with some public use or have been cast
for ecclesiastical purposes. Such events were often
attended by kings and queens and great ecclesiastics,
who threw into the melting-pot contributions of
silver and gold, inscriptions upon the bells themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
often recording the special object of their
manufacture.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of casting bells a
distance away from the tower where they were to be
hung often induced the founders to cast them on the
spot; indeed, as late as 1762 the clock bell of
Canterbury was recast in the Cathedral yard.</p>


<h3>Great Bells of Historic Fame.</h3>

<p>There are many great bells of historic fame, and
others which have gained notoriety from their great
size. The claim to the possession of the largest bell
was formerly made by the Chinese, but the palm is
usually accorded to the Great Bell of Moscow, which
measures 19 ft. in height and 64 ft. in circumference.
In our own country there are the Great
Bell of St. Paul's, weighing five tons; "Great Tom"
of Lincoln, of similar weight; "Peter" of York,
weighing ten tons; and "Big Ben" of Westminster,
scaling fourteen tons.</p>

<p>Some old churches and cathedrals are noted more
for their beautiful chimes than for the size and weight
of their larger bells. At Mechlin there are forty-four
bells in the carillon, and in Antwerp Cathedral the
chimes are played on sixty-five bells, the oldest in
the set, named "Horrida," being dated 1316, but the
bell which is said to be the best loved of all by the
ringers is stamped "Carolas," having been given by
Charles V.</p>

<p>There are bells of lesser size which have gained
popularity, some from their former associations;
others perhaps, more so because of their present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
location or ownership. Sometimes bells have been
removed from old churches and after having changed
hands several times have found a resting-place in the
possession of laymen; often in museums, it is true,
but not always so: as an instance there is the fine
old bell in the possession of the Grocers' Company,
cast in 1463 for the Church of All Hallows, Staining,
where it hung for many years. The bell illustrated
in Fig. 52, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum,
is of more recent date, having been cast in Exeter in
1670 by John Pennington.</p>

<p>Bells have frequently been brought to this country
as trophies of war. At the Tower there are several
fine examples of Eastern workmanship, and there
are others now in the United Service Museum at
Whitehall.</p>


<h3>The Uses of Bells.</h3>

<p>The older bells have seen varied service; they
have been hung in church towers and in public
places; they have sounded the note of alarm, and
given the signal for historic assemblies; they have
rung the death-knell of illustrious persons, and in
rural England have summoned many generations of
worshippers to Divine Service.</p>

<p>The bells, the loud clanging of which can be heard
afar, are, however, the outcome of a gradual process
of development. The evolution from the handbell
to the turret bell was doubtless slow.</p>

<p>The simple handbell in its early stages was only a
slight advance beyond the bells hung round the
necks of the leaders of the flock, which were made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the village smith. Such primitive, and not always
musical, bells were used from the earliest times to
summon servants and workers in the field and
tenderers of the flock. The practice dates from
Biblical days, for it was an early Eastern custom for
sheiks and patriarchs from their tent doors to
summon their followers, or give the danger signal, by
means of a bell.</p>

<p>Bible records tell of bells of gold suspended from
the robes of priests, and of their use in temple
worship. From that time onward they have been
associated with religious ceremonials. In later times
the early Christians employed bells of copper and
brass and consecrated them to their use. Thus
musical peals, rung collectively or individually, have
sounded for all kinds of sacred rites. The bell&mdash;a
mere handbell&mdash;was soon fixed over a doorway, or
in some convenient place where it could with greater
ease be rung by a cord. Then came the suggestion
of larger bells, afterwards covered over, and finally
hung in steeple or tower, like the campanile (a tower
separated from the church) so often met with in Italy.</p>

<p>The church bell is said to have been introduced here
by Paulinus, the Bishop of Mona, in <span class="f75">A.D.</span> 400. The
next record of importance is the historical account of
the Venerable Bede, who describes bells hung in towers&mdash;that
was in <span class="f75">A.D.</span> 670. Some two hundred years
after Bede's days a peal was rung for the first time in
England, in the Abbey of Crowland. The pioneers
of bell-ringing upon bells tuned in harmony were the
ringers who produced such charming results with the
bells of King's College, Cambridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The bells of churches were rung for ecclesiastical
and for national and parochial purposes. There was
the vesper bell for evensong, and there was the
curfew bell which rang in obedience to the "lights
out" enactments of Norman days (see <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Couvre de
feu</i>, <a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>).</p>

<p>Of the minor uses of bells there are many. In
Tudor days small bells were familiar objects in
hunting. They formed part of the equipment of the
hawk or falcon. Of these we read in Shakespeare's
works&mdash;of the "'larum bell and of sweet bells jangled
out of tune." In <cite>Othello</cite> there is a record of the
"snorting citizen with his bell."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span></p>

<p>Bellmen were the heralds of news in country towns,
and the importance of their office was made clear by
the "Oyez! Oyez!" by which they prefixed their
tale. The ancient watchman clanged his bell and
the light in the lantern slung at his waist flickered as
he sounded the call. This is mentioned in an old
ballad, the first verse of which reads:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Time, master, calls your bellman to his task,</div>
<div class="verse">To see your doors and windows are all fast."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Numerous examples of curious bells are to be seen
in our museums. In the Welsh Museum at Cardiff
there is an old Celtic bell from Llangwynodl, shown
side by side with an electrotype of the famous bell of
St. Patrick. There is rather a sad note in the story
of the fate of the old division bell of the Irish House
of Commons, which, when the Parliament was
abolished, was sold for use in a Dublin theatre as
a call bell, eventually to be resold as old metal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
That curio would at this juncture have been regarded
as an historical relic of some value.</p>

<p>The restoration of bells sometimes leads to mistakes
when it is found that the inscriptions upon them
appear to indicate an older date than would be
judged to be correct from their appearance. Of such
restoration work an instance may be given of the
peal of twelve bells recently placed in the tower of
St. Mary's Church, which has become the cathedral
of the new diocese of Chelmsford. The bells were
dedicated in the presence of ringers from a large
number of towns and villages in Essex, a county
noted for its bell-towers and bells. The peal of ten
replaces one cast in 1777, and the old inscriptions
have been placed on the new bells. One reads:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Tho' much against us may be said,</div>
<div class="verse">To speak for ourselves we are not afraid."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Perhaps one of the most pleasing thoughts associated
with bells is that their earliest use has been perpetuated
throughout the ages. The sheep bell hung
round the neck of the bellwether in Eastern lands
sounding so sweetly in the days of the Psalmist of
old, finds its replica on the downlands of the Southern
counties and on Salisbury Plain to-day, for there and
in many other parts of rural England the tinkling
jingle of the sheep bells may be heard.</p>

<p>Bells are not without their rivals, for gongs have
been used in Eastern countries for years, and now
they are popular elsewhere. They were originally a
disc of beaten metal with upturned rim, although in
some countries they took the place of drums in warfare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
as well as playing a part in religious services.
The circular gong is associated with China, Japan,
and Java. The Burmese gong is of triangular form,
and by way of contrast is made of polished metal,
whereas those of the first-mentioned countries usually
show hammer marks. Many of the old gongs were
exceedingly musical, and when struck with a leather-covered
wooden mallet were capable of producing a
variety of sounds. Gongs old and new vary in size
and, consequently, in depth of tone and volume of
sound. Among the Eastern curios there are some
highly decorative examples, especially among the
smaller table gongs, the stands of which were often
enriched by decorative ornament with inlays and
enamels.</p>


<h3>Old Mortars.</h3>

<p>On account of being made of the same kind of
alloy, bronze mortars are referred to in this chapter.
They were usually cast by the bellfounders from the
metal they used for bells, and many of them when
struck give forth sonorous and deep-toned sounds.
These mortars were moulded and often decorated
with fanciful designs, frequently with the arms or
initials of the prospective owners, others being dated.
Those shown in Fig. 53 are representative types.</p>

<p>Many of the early mortars appear to have been
imported into this country. The Dutch founders
made many in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
some being especially handsome and of large
size. Others still more ornate were of Italian,
Portuguese, and Spanish origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>In course of time the use of bell-metal was discarded,
and brass mortars, cast and afterwards turned
in a lathe, came into vogue. These gradually
became little used, and when pestles and mortars
were needed in the domestic kitchen, more modern
types of marble and composition were introduced.
To-day, these once necessary domestic appliances
are relegated to the chimney-piece as honoured
ornaments in the kitchen; the older and more
valuable bell-metal mortars being given more
prominent positions upon sideboard or cabinet.
Such is the story of the bellfounders, whose art
remains among modern crafts.</p>

<p class="chapblock">The ancient horn&mdash;The badge of office&mdash;Weighing instruments&mdash;Measures
in Exeter Museum&mdash;Our standards.</p>


<p>The sounding of brass and the tinkling of cymbals
have heralded in many State pageants. Civic pomp
and splendour have been enriched by brilliant
uniforms, and the sunlight has flashed on many
a thrilling event in national history. In the relics
of former glories we find emblems of the doings
of the past, and amidst ruined buildings or those
halls now shorn of much of their former grandeur&mdash;their
original purpose forgotten, or, perchance, misunderstood&mdash;the
collector seeks symbols of office and
hoards them when found as mere curios.</p>

<p>In this chapter such civic emblems and prosaic
weights and measures are grouped. A curious
combination some may think. Very appropriate,
however, when we note the close connection which
once existed between those old corporations and
guilds who rejoiced in emblems of office and enjoyed
the custody of standards of weights and measures,
fulfilling the duties which had been thrust upon them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
by powers and authorities only too willing to depute
to private bodies necessary work for which they had
no equipment and no organization.</p>


<h3>The Ancient Horn.</h3>

<p>Civil authority and even State control could, in
days gone by, only be sustained by plenty of pomp
and show. The populace were awed by giant
insignia and much parade of power to enforce the
authority held. In days before there were newspapers
to make announcements, and no printing
presses to print posters and proclamations, the
calling of a public meeting at which declarations
could be made or decisions arrived at, was a matter
of no small importance. The sounding horn had
been used from primitive times to call together
the people, and the gatherings of the folk mote
were heralded in and assembled by a loud blast
on the "moot horn." The moot or meeting of the
people of a village or hamlet began in Anglo-Saxon
times, when such assemblies were held in the open
air. Later came the moot hall, which preceded the
guildhall of days when traders and merchants were
incorporated into fraternal guilds. The horn was
the signal for calling such assemblies commonly in
use in old towns, and such relics of the past are
now preserved with care&mdash;emblems of altered times
to those who are familiar with them. In Fig. 55 is
shown the moot horn of Winchester, a beautiful
example of ancient metal-work. There is a similar
horn at Dover, which is sounded still according to
custom at the election of the mayor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The moot horn is not quite lost in modern procedure,
for the heralds march in Royal processions
and precede the proclamation of regal and civic
state as of yore, on those rare occasions calling a
halt from everyday occupations by the trumpet's
blast.</p>

<h3>The Badge of Office.</h3>

<p>The mace is with us to-day as the chief emblem
of office. Without it no civil gathering of importance
in London would be complete, and when
robbed of its presence no law can be enacted at
Westminster. The "bauble" Cromwell caused to
be removed was a symbol of historic and ancient
fame, deep-rooted in the minds of even stern
Puritans. It had to be banished ere the Parliament
was dissolved!</p>

<p>The mace is truly the lineal and direct sign of
power and authority, for it was the ancient battle-axe
which could deal the deadly blow that was first held
up before the sovereign, and in brass or gilt the
tawdry symbol took its place and has ever since
retained its significance.</p>

<p>In lesser degree the staff or stave of office has
remained an ensign of authority. The heads of
such staves are often decorative and surmounted
by some appropriate emblem or well-known sign
of office.</p>

<p>The flagstaff head shown in Fig. 54 is of eighteenth-century
date; its very beautiful openwork ornament
was probably of gilt. It is an excellent example of
English workmanship of that period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>


<h3>Weighing Instruments.</h3>

<p>The Founders' Company exercised an oversight
over weighing instruments and weights and had
difficulties to contend with, for there were many
irregularities and not a few differences in the
standards used in various localities. The scales of
traders of olden time were far from accurate, and
there was abundant need of standard weights and
measures such as were kept in some of the old
country towns. Winchester and Exeter are two
places where care has been taken of the old standards,
and in both of these towns ancient standards may be
seen. Similar standards formerly kept in other
towns have been scattered, and not infrequently
old specimens&mdash;obviously standards from the inscriptions
upon them&mdash;are met with in private
collections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

(<em>Sketched by permission of the Corporation of the City of Winchester.</em>)</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span></p>

<p>Those now in the Winchester Museum extend
over a considerable period, ranging in antiquity from
the reign of Henry III to Elizabeth. The original
bushel which became the standard on which other
measures were based is still preserved in Winchester.
In the reign of Henry VII, one William Nele was
commissioned to make further copies, on which the
sum of fifty pounds was expended. The transaction
was recorded in the State papers of 1486 as follows:
"To William Nele, gunn founder and brasier of
London, upon makyng of diverse measures and
weights accordinge to the olde Standarde of
Englande, to be sent into several shires and cities
of Englande, accordinge to the King's commandment,
and by the advice of the Counsaal at diverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
tymes." The ancient bronze bushel of great historic
interest is illustrated in Fig. 56. Among the other
standards kept with the "bushel" in the Winchester
Museum are those shown in Fig. 57&mdash;all measures
based on similar standards. Tudor examples are
also still in the possession of the local authorities
at Norwich, Salisbury, Northampton, Southampton,
and Exeter. Fig. 58 is another example of
a pint measure, dated 1601, the crowned initials
"E.R." upon it, of course, indicating "<span class="f75">ELIZABETH
REGINA</span>." A later Winchester pint, dated 1704, is
shown in Fig. 59.</p>

<h3>Measures in Exeter Museum.</h3>

<p>When it was enacted in the reign of Henry VII
that certain towns should hold copies of the ancient
standards, Exeter was the city chosen wherein were
deposited the standards for the Shire of Devon.
They are now on view in the Royal Albert Memorial
Museum in Exeter, supplemented by other standards
legalized by Queen Elizabeth, and by more recent
copies of authorized standards. There are five
standards, dated 1799, consisting of the Winchester
bushel, peck, and half-peck, and standard coal
measure of peck and half-peck. A bronze standard
of the time of William and Mary is engraved "<span class="f75">FOR
THE CITTY AND COVNTY OF EXON 1689</span>;" and a
standard gallon, embossed with crown and monogram,
is engraved "<span class="f75">E.R. ELIZABETH REGINA, 1601</span>;".
There are also standard wine measures; one engraved
on one side "<span class="f75">CITY OF EXETER 1797</span>" and on the
reverse "<span class="f75">HALF PINT. WINE</span>," and another on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
reverse, "<span class="f75">GILL. WINE</span>." An exceptionally interesting
piece is a standard ale gallon of the time of the
Commonwealth, engraved "<span class="f75">AN ALE GALLON SIZED
AND SEALED IN THE TOWER OF LONDON BY ME
JOHN REYNOLDS OF THE MYNT. ANO.</span> 1653."
Among the standard weights included in this
interesting exhibit is a 14 lb. bronze weight of the
time of Henry VII, embossed with portcullis and
rose, and engraved "<span class="f75">HENRIC SEPTIM.</span>" It was
found some years ago among old metal at a store
in Exeter, the manner of its discovery indicating
the possibility of further finds of a similar nature
in other towns. The little Troy weights are exceptionally
well preserved; the weights according to
their engraving are 32 oz., 64 oz., 128 oz., and
256 oz. On the largest specimen the legend runs:
"<span class="f75">ANO. DO. EL. REG. XXX.</span> 1588." and on the upper
edge, "<span class="f75">CCLVI.</span>", the smaller weights being similarly
indicated. These were all used as the standards
at Exeter until the year 1824. Another interesting
specimen is the standard yard and ell bed used in
Exeter for testing the rods used as cloth measures,
the groove on the standard on the engraved side
being one yard, that on the reverse one ell (=45
inches). The inscription on the standard yard
reads: "<span class="f75">CIVITAS EXON CHRISTOPHER COKE ESQ.
MAYOR. WILLIAM BOLITHO RECEIVER</span> 1693." In
the same museum there are also six brass stamping
blocks formerly in use at the Exeter Custom House
in connection with old Exeter trades.</p>

<p>Medi√¶val London yields the collector many
choice pieces. Beautiful little scale beams of bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and brass have been found in or near London Wall.
Scales of antiquity, too, have sometimes been in the
possession of old families for centuries almost without
their knowing or appreciating their value. Not
long ago some beautiful little scales made of brass,
which must have been made more than two hundred
years ago, were picked up on an old barrow where
the man who bought "odd things" had it for sale
and thought it to be one of the almost valueless
curios in the remains of sundries he had bought
from the caretaker of an empty house. In the
Guildhall Museum there are scales and weights of
types usual in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
centuries. One of these is decorated with
a band of stars, another of triangular shape is
stamped with a merchant's mark&mdash;that also was
found on the site of London Wall. Another
remarkably interesting curio is an octagonal weight
evidently answering the purpose of a baker's weight,
and perhaps as an advertisement, too, for it is
engraved, "<span class="f75">WEIGHT OF A QUARTERN LOAF, SOLD
BY JAMES BULL, 124, LEADENHALL STREET</span>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span></p>

<p>In this connection it may be pointed out that
a very pleasing collection can inexpensively be
made out of old money changers' weights, both
English and foreign. They were chiefly used with
the pocket scales at one time carried about by
traders as a precaution against the numerous clipped
and light-weight coins in circulation. Among these
little weights are those which were used for testing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
what are now obsolete gold coins, such as angel,
guinea, half-guinea, and seven-shilling piece.</p>

<p>Some of the old Roman bell weights are interesting;
they took their shape from more ancient
weights in the form of a pagan deity, probably
Mercury, who was looked upon as a god of scales
and weights. In some collections larger Continental
weights are met with; those illustrated in Fig. 60
representing three French weights preserved in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>When examining old weights and measures we
often wonder at the origin of such curious tables
of weight formulated on somewhat perplexing
standards, ridiculed as long obsolete by supporters
of the metric systems. They would sweep them
away; but to do so would snap one more link
with the historic past, and perhaps cause us to
forget the very simple origin of so many of our
so-called complicated systems, the outcome of a
slowly developing commerce&mdash;very different now to
the days when our standards were formulated. The
baseline of our weights and measures is to be found
in a single grain of corn, such as would seem to be
Nature's gift&mdash;the staff of life! It was a natural
standard for agriculturists, who would be the first to
use it, to adopt. Not only was the grain of corn the
standard of measurement and weight, but a given
number gave the weight value to the penny sterling.
The grain retained its prominent position in our
calculations long after standards had been fixed,
for in the reign of Henry VII it was enacted that
the bushel measure should contain eight gallons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
wheat, and that the gallon should weigh eight pounds,
the pound to be of twelve ounces Troy, each ounce
equal to twenty silver pennies, every one of which
should be of weight equivalent to thirty-two grains
of dry wheat.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that a still earlier standard&mdash;that
of the Roman Empire&mdash;was based on barleycorns,
of which there were twenty-four to the ounce,
a measurement adopted at Troyes, in France, having
been brought from Cairo during the Crusades. Thus
in this simple story we see the origin of Troy weight
which in after years was used concurrently with the
later <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avoirdupois</i> (goods by weight), the standard
adopted for heavy wares.</p>

<p class="chapblock">Early figure modelling&mdash;Statues in public places&mdash;Replicas in miniature.</p>


<p>The art of sculpture was practised by the ancients,
and long before the beautiful bronzes for which the
artists of Greece and Rome were famous carvers of
wood, and sculptors of stone and marble, had cut
inscribed, and fashioned human figures, animals, and
fabulous creatures according to their whims and
fancies. In moulds cut in stone the early casters in
metal produced the objects which we roughly class as
bronze, and they are preserved to-day as reminders of
those who lived before history was written. When
the early Bronze Age had passed away and the use
of iron was understood, the art of sculpture in stone
was practised by the Egyptians and by other Eastern
nations. Then came the beautiful metal-work of
Ancient Greece; the statues, trophies, and groups,
produced in those days when Greece excelled in the
fine arts, have acquired a fame which has never been
exceeded by sculptors or workers in metals in modern
days. The Italians of a later period showed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
religious emotions in the metallic works of art
they produced in early medi√¶val days; and still
later French modellers have excelled in human
expression.</p>

<p>Many of the great works of the old masters in
bronze are unique, and they are retained as great
treasures in the national museums where they have
found lasting homes. For the benefit of connoisseurs
of art many of the great works have been
copied, and in the Victoria and Albert Museum at
South Kensington and in other places there are
replicas in metal and in other materials, faithful
copies of the original bronzes which are so rare.
The educational value of a gallery of ancient art,
whether expressed in marble, bronze, stone, or other
materials, is considerable; it not only tends to the
appreciation of modern art as represented by the
statues and monuments in our parks and gardens,
and in those smaller works which adorn public
buildings and private mansions, but it leads to the
appreciation of the lesser replicas of great works, such
as artistic groups, figures, and bronzes which have
been copied in miniature. Many of the most important
works of the modeller and caster of bronze
groups and figures are familiar to students of art and
collectors of curios, in that so many of these
important studies have been reproduced or copied;
sometimes the copies are equally as beautiful as the
original, although on a smaller scale, and many of
them have quite an antique appearance, for they are
by no means modern, such works of art having been
reproduced very many years ago.</p>

<h3>Early Figure Modelling.</h3>

<p>The human figure in its most perfectly known form
was early made the model from which artists sculptured
stone and moulded figures. Even some of the
crude attempts of native races have evidently been
intended to represent human beings with whom they
associated or races they held in fear, but they were
not always successful. Bronze statues cast in moulds
were known in Egypt, and throughout later periods
most of the civilized races have employed methods
by which they have been able with more or less
accuracy to reproduce in other substances of a more
lasting character the perishable flesh and blood of
the human race. In a similar way the personified
deities have been perpetuated in bronze and many of
them are simply idolized humanity. Sometimes
these statues have been very large, far beyond what
is generally known as life-size. It must be remembered,
however, that many of these colossal statues
when raised to a great height are by no means out of
proportion to the buildings on which they were placed,
and assumed a normal size when viewed from below.
It is said that one of the most striking colossal figures
was that of Minerva, crowning the summit of the
Acropolis. The largest statue seems to be that of
Nero, which rose 150 ft. In more modern times
statues have been brought down to normal size.
Visitors to Rome, however, recognise what a wonderful
achievement it must have been to place that immense
statue of St. Peter in position. The artists of old
were indeed clever, and not only have they justly
been accorded fame for the size and beautiful proportions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of their statues, but many of the ancient bronzes
have gained their greatest notoriety from the great
beauty with which the sculptors must have idealized
their models. Many of the antiques are almost
perfect in form, and we are forced to wonder what
kind of men and women their models were.</p>


<h3>Classic Models.</h3>

<p>The classic bronzes were almost invariably conceptions
drawn from imagination, but the beautiful
forms of the athletes and Greek maidens helped the
artist in his estimate of the deities he personified.
In those bronzes we see the magic touch of the
master hand, and perhaps of the belief in the mystic
attributes so cleverly designed. Thus we have
figures of Hercules, Mars, Venus, and many others,
which can be copied, and now and then by some
stroke of good luck a genuine antique is added to
the collector's museum.</p>


<h3>Statues in Public Places.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span></p>

<p>During the last half-century simple statues
erected to the memories of noted politicians and
military men in public parks, streets, and open
places, have been added to by more realistic groups.
It would be beyond the scope of this work to attempt
categorical descriptions of such bronzes to be seen in
the public places of our great cities, and it would be
still more difficult to rightly classify them either in
their order of merit or of the appropriateness of their
selection. It seems justly fit that those who have
been associated with the metallic art should be commemorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in copper and brass. To Pittsburg
belongs the honour of having remembered the father
of the art of hammering into shape the metals. In
that city, on a massive pedestal, stands a colossal
bronze figure of Tubal Cain, who, in his brief life's
history given in Genesis, is spoken of as an "artificer
in brass." He fittingly heads the list of metallurgists
and scientists, to many of whom monuments have
been erected.</p>

<p>The use of bronze in monuments is not confined to
figures of great men, for bronze and brass ornament
often adds to the magnificence of a national memorial.
As examples of the use of bronze for that purpose
mention may be made of the bronze lions, after
Landseer, at the four corners of Nelson's Column in
Trafalgar Square. The use of bronze, as adding to
the adornment or appearance of an antiquity in stone,
is exemplified in the two bronze sphinxes at the base
of Cleopatra's Needle on the Thames Embankment.</p>

<p>The bronzes of comparatively modern days are
mostly the work of the founder, cast after the sculptor
has done his work. Some of the early examples of
Etruscan and Egyptian art consisted of bronze or
brass hammered into form by hand, or made of plates
riveted together. Others appear to have been beaten
or embossed into high relief in a mould. Some of
the cleverest castings of bronze, however, are found
in the work of Eastern nations, the best examples
being idols and temple ornaments (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>).</p>


<h3>Replicas in Miniature.</h3>

<p>The so-called miniatures range from important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
reproductions for household and gallery ornament to
the quite miniature bronzes which adorn the mantelpiece
or cabinet. Many of the statues and groups of
ancient and modern forms have been copied. There
is, however, another school of art which to many is
very attractive. Just as pictures of animal life are
appreciated by many, so the sculptures and bronzes
of well-known animal artists have been justly appreciated.
In France there are the works of Antoine
Louis Barye, who was born in Paris in 1795. It is
said that Barye discovered his real bent from watching
the wild beasts in the Jardin des Plantes. Some of
his great works were exhibited early in the nineteenth
century, and his beautiful models have been
much copied. Three of the most popular are shown
in Figs. 61, 62, and 63. There is the tiger which he
exhibited in 1830, and the lion and the beautifully
formed stag. Such works of art are worthy of a
place in any collection of metal, for they represent
an important French school. Of men who have
made names for themselves there are many whose
statues are found in private collections. A very
favourite one is that of Robert Burns, whose colossal
statue was erected at Ayr on the occasion of the
one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the poet's
birth. Burns is reported to have said on his deathbed:
"They'll think mair o' me a hundred years
after I am dead," a truism none will deny.</p>

<p class="chapblock">Countries of origin&mdash;How some Oriental curios are derived&mdash;A
wealth of metal on view&mdash;Various Indian wares&mdash;Chinese and
Japanese art.</p>


<p>Under the somewhat generic term "Oriental" we
class those numerous bronzes and other art treasures
which come to us from the East and the Far East.
Early in the medi√¶val days Eastern influence dominated
the craftsmen of Europe, and many of those
who took part in the Crusades, and later in adventurous
journeys into the northern part of Africa,
bordering upon the Great Sea, brought back to their
Western homes curios which were undoubtedly
Oriental in their design.</p>


<h3>Countries of Origin.</h3>

<p>A collection of copper and brass to be at all
representative must be varied and cosmopolitan in
selection. Such a collection should include vessels
of utility and ornamental objects which show the
aims of the artist who designed them. Incidentally,
too, such objects exhibit the sameness of purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
existing in many lands; although the methods of
domestic procedure and the ways of living vary until
their common origin is scarcely recognizable. In
such a collection of domestic curios the influence
of Saracenic art is seen in the ewers and basins and
similar vessels which come from the lands where the
wild Arab tribes lived for centuries in an almost
barbarous state on the edge of the Syrian desert.
Many of these quaint hammered copper vessels are
of barbaric beauty, such as, for instance, the coffee-pot
shown in Fig. 64 and the basin in Fig. 65.</p>

<p>There are some pleasing customs savouring of
patriarchal days still practised by Arab races.
Such, for instance, when the sheik has finished his
morning meal he throws a stone into his brass or
copper coffee-pot as a sign to his followers to
strike camp.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a></span></p>

<p>The Arab metal-work is generally covered over
with characteristic designs and distinctive styles.
Equally characteristic is the finely engraved ornament
on many small brass objects made by Arab
craftsmen. This is exemplified in the small and
beautifully engraved brass writing boxes which were
once a feature among the educated scribes of Arab
fame. One such case is to be seen in the British
Museum, the work of Mahmud, son of Souker, of
Bagdad, made in 1281. The style is said by experts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to combine the art motives of Mesapotamia and
Egypt, which in the thirteenth century very naturally
met in Syria. Another distinctive style is noticeable
in the art of the metal-workers of the Mameluke
dynasty of Egypt; their arabesques showed more
realistic foliage than the Arab decorations of an
earlier date.</p>

<p>Antiquaries always turn quite naturally to Egypt,
that land with such a great past, when seeking for
inspiration from the great monuments which are
masterpieces of art&mdash;in bronze and stone. These
they find there it is true, but the more important
pieces of metal-work of that early period are found
in Assyria, from whence came ponderous gates of
brass, covered with the remains of delicate tracery
and inscriptions. Such works of ancient art are
rightly given places of prominence in our museums;
the private collector, however, is generally content
with the lesser bronze antiquities of Egypt which he
can <em>collect</em>. These include mirrors and many small
articles for the toilet and some delightful domestic
bronzes. Among them are charming little ewers
with long projecting spouts and curiously wrought
curved handles ornamented with masks and shells.</p>

<p>The curios which reach us from Cairo are mostly
in strict accordance with Egyptian characteristics.
The earlier examples are representative of the art
of Northern Egypt as it was expressed by the metal-workers
between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries,
throughout which there does not appear to have
been any great divergence of style, although when
objects known to have been made during the earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
part of that period, and others fashioned during the
later, the progress and development, although it
had been slow, is very noticeable. There are also
some traces of outside influences. In Fig. 10 there
is an early lamp of brass in the form of a bird,
inlaid with copper, an example placed in the
thirteenth century. Quite different is the late
example (eighteenth century) given in Fig. 64,
which is a coffee-pot with a bucket handle and
another small handle at the back; the spout is
roughly worked with corrugations and quatrefoils,
on the five bosses being the marks adopted by
the owner of the shop in Cairo where it was used.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the influence
of Saracenic art upon metal-workers in places where
the Saracens came in contact with the craftsmen.
As indicative of this feature the fine large brass
basin illustrated in Fig. 65 is shown. Some portions
of the bowl have evidently been filled in with silver.
There are other objects such as bowls, dishes, and
ewers showing similar decorations, many of which
may be seen along with this example in the Victoria
and Albert Museum.</p>

<p>The Saracens seem to have had some influence
upon what are usually regarded as European articles;
thus in a collection of old bronze mortars there
are sometimes examples from countries in the
South of Europe which show in their designs these
characteristics. The mortar had, of course, a very
general use, and was needed everywhere in days
when so many compounds were prepared by hand
labour.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a></span></p>

<p>Persian art is peculiarly specialistic in its treatment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
The designs used by the metal-workers in
that country from quite early days were emblematic
and of an all-over conventional type, often interwoven
with scenes. Even many of the common
vessels, like bowls and covers and saucers of brass,
are cleverly chased with hunting scenes and floral
attributes, many of the cups being covered with
arabesque ornament.</p>

<p>Some of the brass egg-shaped hooker bases are
chased in relief; the mounts of the rose-water
ewers&mdash;which are often of china, with metal linings
for holding ice&mdash;are frequently decorative. In many
instances the vessels are ornamented with coloured
inlays, giving them peculiar colour effects. Damascus&mdash;always
an important seat of metal-work&mdash;has
supplied collectors from many countries with the
beautifully incised ornament produced by filling in
the cut spaces with fine gold or silver wire beaten
into the brass and then polished. So important
has this mode of giving relief become that damascened
metal stands alone as an art, seen at its best
in the wonderful armour of the later period, when
the utility of plate armour was giving way to the
ornament which embellished the State armour&mdash;the
"dress suits" of the regimentals of the Stuart
days.</p>


<h3>How some Oriental Curios are Derived.</h3>

<p>It is useful at times to consider how the curios
we collect have gradually accumulated, and thus
to ascertain how they have been secured in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
past; and from that we are enabled to form some
estimate of further supplies, for the law of supply
and demand regulates to some extent the market
value of curios; it has something to do with the
direction taken by curio-hunters.</p>

<p>Many curios have come into this country as the
result of war and loot. Wars in the Far East have
served the collector, and many choice bits of metal-work
have changed hands at nominal sums after
the return of troops employed in minor wars and
punitive expeditions. Our vast Indian Empire,
however, supplies many beautiful objects in metal,
both ancient and of comparatively recent days, but
even those are so quaint and so unlike the common
objects of British make with which we are familiar
that they are welcomed and find a fitting place
among antique copper and brass.</p>

<p>To understand the curios which may be bought
in Eastern bazaars, and more conveniently in the
numerous stores and shops where Indian curios are
sold, it is well to become acquainted with a really
good representative collection, such as that which
may be examined in the Indian Museum at South
Kensington. In several galleries, arranged in cases
according to the districts from which the specimens
have been gathered, are to be found metal-work
ranging from the sixteenth century to the present
day. Although some of these are exceptional pieces,
by far the larger number are helpful to the collector
of even modest means in that they represent Indian
curios which may be collected at trifling cost. Such
objects, however, are unfortunately too often intermixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
with modern castings and copies offered
unblushingly by the dealer to the unwary. Among
such curios from Indian bazaars, purchased by
travellers to the less frequented districts, are very
many cooking utensils. Some of these, although
not very old, are quaint and unlike modern European
vessels, for the native cooks have been slow to
accept any change in their methods of cooking and
do not take kindly to the use of Western types
of culinary appliances. The Indian cook clings
tenaciously to copper vessels, and notwithstanding
attempts to introduce vessels of tin, aluminium, and
enamelled ware, the old "chattie" is again and again
brought out in preference. Most of the vessels are
of primitive types, but they serve the purpose and
the material is good and lasting. The native
workers understand the requirements of Indian men
and women, and can shape and hammer together
just what they have for generations regarded as
"the best." Clever indeed have been the native
braziers in the past&mdash;and they still are&mdash;for they
possess in addition to knowledge of coppersmithing
an excellent knowledge of the composition and
working qualities of the materials they employ.
They understand something of the chemistry of
metals, and are careful when melting copper in
the furnace or over the fire not to overheat it,
or to allow the metal to perish in processes of
manufacture.</p>


<h3>A Wealth of Metal on View.</h3>

<p>The collection of Asiatic metal-work where specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
from different countries, made at various periods,
can be compared is, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, that in the Indian
Museum (the best examples of richly wrought damascened
armour and arms are found in the Wallace
Collection and at the Tower). The visitor on
entering is at once absorbed in admiring Indian
curiosities, especially the products of native craftsmen.
In the vestibule are many remarkable exhibits, the
work of Nepal metal-workers. Most of them were
gifts to King George and Queen Mary when they
visited India on the occasion of the great Coronation
Durbar at Delhi. Some of the larger pieces were
the gift of the Maharajah and Prime Minister of
Nepal. Very wonderful is their workmanship,
especially that of the brass groups so true to life.
One of these represents a hunting elephant, fully
equipped, with attendants; others, too, are associated
with sports and hunting scenes. There are emblems
of demons and the evil spirits which are so fully
believed in by native dwellers on the borders of the
forest.</p>

<p>Temple vessels are abundant, and among them
are monsters and other fabulous creatures, and
numbers of masks, notably those representing the
fierce Dragpo fiend Tamdin (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>).
There are some fine temple sets, and two magnificent
conventional lions (temple guardians). There is also
a very interesting brass group of natives occupied
in various ways, one, for instance, carrying a package
on his shoulder illustrating the method of relieving
the weight of the bundle by a forehead strap, by which
means natives are enabled to sustain the strain.</p>

<p>So intricate are many of these cleverly modelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
groups that it is not always easy to understand how
they have been cast. Especially remarkable is the
founding of the figure groups produced by the
natives of the Patan district of Nepal. In most
cases they accomplished their task by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">circe perdu</i>
process (see <a href="#GLOSSARY">Glossary</a>), which enables them to cast
even the most delicate groups.</p>

<p>Some very interesting wares in metal are obtained
from Moradabad; they are smooth and beautifully
finished, made of brass, and partly tinned. The more
decorative pieces are of the early nineteenth century,
and include such objects as plates, water-jars,
tumblers, and sugar-pots and covers. From Lucknow
some fine trays are secured; and many beautiful
brass ewers, bowls, and basins have been obtained
from Haidarabad, where not only comparatively
modern but early eighteenth-century brasswork is
to be found. Some of these have a pleasing effect
when polished, the design or pattern upon them
being inlaid with copper on a brass foundation
and then polished.</p>


<h3>Various Indian Wares.</h3>

<p>There is an Indian ware known as <em>bidri</em>, beautifully
damascened in gold on a brass and copper base,
chiefly made in the villages round Lucknow and
Deccan from the seventeenth century onwards.
The peculiarity of these objects is that they are
distinctly black and white, the metal consisting
of an alloy of zinc, copper, and lead afterwards
damascened with silver which is finally blackened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
by pickling. A favourite curio is a Betel-nut box
and cover; there are also spice boxes and objects
intended for the base of a water-pipe. Many of
the choice curios from Kashmir in Northern India
are mostly of a dark red-brown copper, and are
frequently incised and inlaid with lac. Among
them are domestic vessels, the most commonly met
with being the coffee-pot (<em>Kafijosh</em>). In one famous
collection there is a curious boat-shaped alms-bowl
of copper, chased with a running ornament, a design
frequently employed in the eighteenth century.
There are some interesting Mogul brasses, among
which are washhand basins. In these, too, the
decorations are frequently filled in with black lac.
Very different are the brass and copper objects from
the Punjab. Some of pure copper are inlaid with
black lac, others are of copper-gilt, looking in the
sunlight like burnished gold. Some are of brass;
among the older objects of special interest being
charcoal burners of fine brass with dome-shaped
covers. From the Punjab come copper toilet boxes,
which are usually fitted with locks terminating in
the form of a conventional lotus. One of the most
curious treasures in the Indian Museum secured from
that district is a "black" cup, made of a metal composed
of quicksilver and copper, a metallic compound
supposed to give a digestive virtue to any liquid
drank out of it.</p>

<p>The variety of metal objects from Nepal is considerable.
There are articles of home decoration
and usefulness, including charming toilet sundries.
Among the lamps are many weird forms, a favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
being a lamp designed like a peacock's tail supported
by a lion. There are inkpots of symbolical
forms with figures of Ganasa, the Hindoo god of
wisdom. There are also many decorative water-bottles
and vases and beautifully formed tazzas;
as well as charming toilet boxes with raised diaper
ornament and conventional patterns.</p>

<p>From Madras come bowls and water-bottles and
many delightful trinket boxes, some shaped like
fishes, others of bird-like forms. Some of these
were intended for use as receptacles for antimony
salve, which is so much used in India for the eyes.
Among the more modern curios made during the
latter half of the nineteenth century are spun
and turned brasswork, especially vases and bowls.
Travancore is also famous for its artists in metal,
and especially for their beautiful decorative brass
pots with curious spouts and drinking cups.</p>

<p>The little bullock bells are characteristic of many
parts of India, some being prettily ornamented and
of sweet tinkling sounds. From Southern India
there are Betel-nut cutters of unusual forms, and
quite a variety of metal bowls, some being shaped
like a pumpkin. From the same district come
highly decorative copper plaques and brass salvers
as well as water vessels.</p>

<p>The lamps from India are of equal interest to
those met with among the antiquities of similar
types from other countries. Those of more recent
date, the work of baptized natives, have for the chief
ornament emblems of the Christian religion instead
of those associated with idol worship; although in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
some instances the cross is flanked on either side
with the sun and moon, reminding us of the more
ancient pagan religions.</p>

<p>Many parts of India are noted for beautiful inlaid
lac, much of which is extremely decorative; the
vases illustrated in Fig. 67 came from Moradabad;
they are of red-brown copper relieved with black
lac. Haidarabad is also noted for such wares, in
some instances red as well as black lac being used
in the decorations, which are chiefly of conventional
form.</p>

<p>The brasswork of Benares is well known, and
it is still one of the most important features in
present-day Oriental bazaars and shops. The
modern work, however, rarely comes up to the old,
for in olden time great care was taken in producing
varied forms and correct ornament in decoration,
the chief features of the Benares brasswork being
the series of ten incarnations of Vishnu, represented
so often on trays, bowls, and smaller vessels, such, for
instance, as spice boxes and perfume holders, and
receptacles for pulverized sandal-wood.</p>

<p>The native princes of India have always been
accustomed to State ceremonial, and among the
curious objects from that country are symbols of
office, some of the maces being beautifully damascened
with gold. The ceremonial and State swords
formerly carried by the princes are museum curios
of value, especially those around which the memories
of historical events cluster, such as the gauntlet-sword
of brass, the hilt in the form of a tiger's head,
which formerly belonged to Ruggoneth Sookul, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
saved Captain Gordon's life during the Indian
Mutiny in 1857.</p>

<p>As it has been suggested wars with Oriental
potentates and the annexation of lands which had
previously been under British protection have from
time to time enriched national as well as private
collections. Many of the trophies of war are unique
and do not exist in duplicate. In the Indian
Museum there are many such objects, notably the
one-time regalia of the Kings of Burma; at South
Kensington, too, there is a massive bowl of brass
on which is engraved in picture characters the story
of the history of China as related by Confucius, and
transcribed by his pupil Tso, five hundred years
before the Christian era.</p>

<p>Lamaistic temple curios are referred to in another
chapter. These, however, do not exhaust the metal-work
from Thibet. Indeed, many of the minor
objects, especially those of a domestic character,
are very pleasing. The vessels used in making tea
in Thibet differ from those in China&mdash;the home of
tea-drinking&mdash;in that the process of preparing "the
cup that cheers but not inebriates" is different. The
ladies of Thibet take the tea-leaves and grind them
dry until they are of the consistency of a fine
powder, using a brass mortar for the purpose. They
then put the powdered tea into a kettle, and allow
it to boil for about five minutes. The liquid is afterwards
poured through a strainer into a tea-urn, and a
little butter and barley flour are added. This compound,
after being vigorously churned up, is poured
from the urn of wrought copper into teapots, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
it is allowed to settle before it is served up in
small brass bowls. Ladles are used for the purpose
of taking the tea from the urn, for it has
no tap, being simply a two-handled jar with a
cover.</p>

<p>Some interesting curios are derived from Ceylon,
especially those utensils made by the Sinhalese, who,
it will be remembered, emigrated there from Bengal
in the sixth century. The chief copper-workers in
the island are the Veddahs, an aboriginal tribe
of the interior closely allied to the Sinhalese. Their
work includes copper and brass on which is very
beautiful repouss√© decoration. Buddhist influence
has always been strong in Ceylon, and it is conspicuous
in much of the decoration of the more
important metal-work.</p>

<p>Ceylon casters have turned out some fine bells
and many heavy bronze lamps. The lesser objects,
which are varied, include brass boxes in which the
lime for Betel chewing was kept. Some of these are
circular, and others are pear-shaped, many being
incised and inlaid with the more precious metals.
Betel-nut cutters, similar to those from other parts
of India, are among the collectable curios, those
from Ceylon being especially interesting, for they
frequently take the form of animals or of winged
flying females. The objects enumerated do not by
any means exhaust the metal curios from India and
Ceylon, but they are among the chief features observable
in a large collection, in the gathering together
of which many small trinkets and perhaps unique
sundries will be secured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>


<h3>Chinese and Japanese Art.</h3>

<p>To many the curios from China and Japan are
more familiar than those from India and British
Asiatic possessions. The pottery and porcelain of
China have long been used in this country, and
during recent years other objects of a curious and
antiquarian nature have been imported in large
quantities from both these ancient countries. In
shops and bazaars the metallic wares of China and
Japan have been much popularized too. That
China has a great past and possessed a civilization
hundreds of years before similar conditions appertained
in Europe is well known. Collectors of the
antique go back in their search after specimens of
bronze and other metals to those produced by the
artists of China in the Han Dynasty, which dates
from <span class="f75">B.C.</span> 216. In records of that period, concurrent
with accounts of pottery, there are well authenticated
details of the metal cooking vessels then in common
use. There were utilitarian bronzes and many
beautiful vases, some of almost the same designs
as the concurrent pottery. There were cooking
utensils not at all unlike the medi√¶val bronze pots
of modern Europe; their handles, however, were
more decorative, often taking the form of a
dragon's head. The feet of these ancient cooking-pots
were often like lions' claws or eagles' talons.
Among other relics of that period are quadrangular
wine jars, some of the rarer types being decorated
with fishes, in the drawing of which the Chinese
artists of the Han Dynasty were very clever.
They used such decorations appropriately, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
for this was the ornament they chose on fish
kettles.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the metal-work of the Han period
was the dark red copper which seems to have been
used concurrently with bronze. When we note that
some of the pottery was beautifully formed we can
quite understand that the bronzes were equally well
shaped, for the metal-workers would not be behind
the potters in their craftmanship. Some of the rarer
bronze tazzas are also well shaped and have been
carefully moulded.</p>

<p>The chief curios coming into the hands of collectors
are of a somewhat later date than the Han Dynasty;
but China moves on slowly, and there does not appear
to have been much advance or change for many centuries.
The metal-work made during what we term
medi√¶val days in Europe was often copied from
familiar objects made of other materials. There is
a bronze vase made in the Sung Dynasty, fashioned
in imitation of an old jar tied up with rope, the ring
handles being technically described as "conventional
heads applique"; this vessel measures 14&frac14; in. diameter
at the shoulder and stands 9&frac12; in. high. It is difficult
to trace where such pieces come from; it is, however,
well known that many have been looted from the
temples; others, probably imitating older examples,
are mainly of nineteenth-century workmanship.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a></span></p>

<p>The metal-work which comes from Japan has
reached us in great variety. There has been no need
for the traveller or collector to search the island for
curios to bring over to this country, for the commercial
instincts of a new race of Japanese merchants have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
poured out a wealth of antiques, collected from the
native villages; with these and modern imitations
they have gladly supplied the demand of the Western
world. In this way attention has been called to the
products of that country where craftsmen have gone
on hammering copper and brass, and inlaying the
metal in highly decorated patterns in silver and gold
for so many years.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the rare temple
pieces and sets which have been looted or purchased
from Asiatic countries, so many of which are of rare
cloissonn√© enamels. Some of these of Japanese origin
are mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>. Of the minor
bronzes, replicas of temple relics, there are many
beautiful koros or incense burners. Other bronzes
serve the purpose of ornament in the Western countries
to which they have found their way. In Fig. 68
is shown a beautiful bronze. The sacred carp is inlaid
with gold and silver and is exceptionally well
finished. The pair, of which it is one, came from
Japan about thirty years ago, and are of much finer
workmanship than many of the more modern replicas.</p>

<p>Household requisites as well as ornamental treasures
have been made with care by hammer and engraving
tool into things of beauty as well as usefulness. The
household requirements of the Japanese are limited
in number, but in the entertainment of her friends the
Japanese lady is able to cause envy among her
Western sisters because of the beauty of her kettles
and brazier. The kettle shown in Fig. 66 is one of a
toilet set of hammered brass, engraved with badges
and foliage. It was probably produced early in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
nineteenth century, before Western commercial ideas
began to invade the workshops of Old Japan.
In conjunction with such kettles (the Japanese
name of a kettle is <em>yuwakashi</em>) metal bowls were
used, the water being poured over the hands of
the fair Japanese and her guests by attendants,
who also held the bowl to catch the dropping
water.</p>

<p>In Old Japan there was much patience as well as
skill, and the methods adopted by the artists of those
days would be too tedious and expensive now when
the merchants buy and sell and compete in Western
markets. The processes by which the beautiful
bronze objects were moulded took time, and the
incising and inlays could never be paid for in proper
proportion to the labour expended on them. The
metals of which Japanese bronzes were made consisted
of curious alloys, the composition of which was
long kept a secret. One of their finest brasses is known
as <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">sinchu</i>, consisting of ten parts of copper and five of
zinc. Another very beautiful copper is called <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">shadko</i>,
in which splendid hues are imparted by the treatment
of acids; in this alloy there is one part of gold to ten
of copper, to which is attributable the splendid colouring
of the so-called bronze. Older methods, however,
are gradually giving way to more economic production
on Western plans and formul√¶, so that in time perhaps
the Eastern and Oriental influence and characteristics
of Asiatic bronzes, so charming and so much appreciated
by collectors, may diminish if not disappear
altogether.</p>

<span class="ph3">IDOLS AND TEMPLE RELICS</span></h2>

<p class="chapblock">Varied shrines and many idols&mdash;Indian idols&mdash;Temple vases and
ornaments.</p>


<p>There are some who hold it to be a wicked thing to
loot the temple of a heathen deity, and regard it as
sacrilege to ruthlessly tear down the idol from its
shrine. Others glory in an opportunity of proving
the powerlessness of the man-created idol to save the
temple from ruin and desecration. Yet there are
many who recognize in these idols of wood, stone,
and metal, emblems and symbols of ancient faiths in
which there may be a greater reality, and, for all we
can tell, potency, to those who look beyond the mere
shrine, than appears at first sight. Notwithstanding
all that, the multiplicity of gods and the number of
so-called deities make many sceptical about the
worship of their devotees, and there are few who
feel much compunction when adding such objects as
metal idols to their curios&mdash;when they are able to
secure them honestly.</p>


<h3>Varied Shrines and Many Idols.</h3>

<p>Needless to say the faiths of those who worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
"unknown gods," from whatever source they may
have come, differ. The very uncertainty of the
religions, which admit of varied deities, has fostered
the increase of ceremonies and the change in rites,
which, added to local folk-lore and myths which have
gained in the telling, have caused new idols to be set
up. It was so in pagan Greece and Rome, and it
is the same in some parts of the world to-day. To
these causes we may attribute the number of idols of
different types, or the same idols represented with
other attributes, which the collector of metal meets
with. There is a strange fascination about the stories
of pagan and heathen deities and their influence over
men, and to obtain the full interest and delight from
such a specialized collection the collector must
become a student of Eastern and other religions and
priestcraft.</p>

<p>The temples in which religious rites have been,
and in some instances are still, observed, vary in
importance just as the associations around the
cathedrals and ruined abbeys in our own land differ
from those almost absent in the more recently erected
churches. The wealthy Indian, not unnaturally,
employed artificers in brass to make models of the
great shrines, and some of these rare works of metallic
art are to be seen in the Indian Museum. Several
are of eighteenth-century workmanship, among them
beautifully modelled temples of Krishna. Incidentally
it may be mentioned that secular buildings have been
reproduced too; notably there is a very fine model of
the Palace of the Winds at Jaypore, Rajputana, which
was presented by the Maharajah of Jaypore.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a></span></p>

<p>Some may regard the collection of idols as a curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
hobby; others possibly see in them only art treasures
to be valued for their intrinsic worth, for many idols
are enriched with precious stones and jewels and are
overlaid with gold and silver. Such objects occupy
a different place from the cruder idols of wood and
stone, cut and carved by savage races. We can well
understand that the refined worker in metals spared
no pains to make his idol or fetish beautiful and
something to be admired.</p>


<h3>Indian Idols.</h3>

<p>Of Indian idols there are many: Buddha is so
widely held in esteem that it is no wonder that so
many representations, varying in size, have been
produced. The favourite position, known as the
"Witness" attitude, is that with which collectors
are most familiar.</p>

<p>Indian idols are of many forms, among the commoner
varieties being those of Vishnu, Lakshmi the
wife of Vishnu, and Siva. Many images of copper,
afterwards gilt, come from Thibet and Nepal. The
curiosities associated with the Lamaist worship have
become familiar of late years. One of the representations
of Amida, holding in her hand the teppattsu,
is shown in Fig. 69. A "blue" Tara is
illustrated in Fig. 70; Amitayus is shown in Fig.
71; and Fig. 72 represents Vajra Dharma holding
the dorge. In Fig. 73 Amitayus is again shown
holding the reliquary and wearing a jewelled collar.
An interesting Lamaist altar ornament is a copper
skull bowl, used as a receptacle for the sacred beer or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
wine of life. There are also Thibetian holy water
jugs, beautifully inlaid with silver. In the Victoria
and Albert Museum may be seen a colossal Buddha
(Daibutsu) of sixteenth-century workmanship, which
came from a Japanese temple. Appropriately placed
close to it is a massive pair of lanterns of bronze,
which were originally a gift to the temple of
Miyoshino-tenjin by the feudal lord of the district.
Most of these temple relics&mdash;idols and ornaments&mdash;were
made of a special alloy known in Japan as <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">Kara
kane</i>, which means Chinese metal, from which it may
be inferred that this alloy was known and employed
in China before it came into general use in Japan.</p>


<h3>Temple Vases and Ornaments.</h3>

<p>The mystical beliefs of China are chiefly Buddhism,
Confucianism, and Taoism, to which should be added
ancestor worship, and in connection with all of them
there are special objects of veneration, which we
group together under the somewhat generic term
of "temple relics."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a></span></p>

<p>From Japan as well as China we get many fine
temple sets. Whence come they? some may ask.
Perhaps they have been discarded because they have
been replaced with newer or more elaborate ornaments,
although they may have been obtained through the
cupidity of some of the temple attendants. From
whatever sources they came there are numerous
examples in the London curio-shops and in our
museums. The crane and tortoise have long been
held in veneration in Japan. The tortoise especially
is frequently found on old Chinese pottery and metal-work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
as well as being fashioned in Corea and
Japan. In Fig. 74 there is a Japanese pricket candlestick,
in the form of a crane and tortoise, of eighteenth-century
workmanship, and it evidently formed one of
a set of five altar pieces. Some of the altar sets gave
special prominence to two flower vases as part of the
set, of somewhat later style of decoration to Fig. 90;
it was probably made early in the nineteenth century.
This vase was formerly used in a set in which a figure
of Buddha occupied the centre. It was a common
practice to hang over the Buddhist altars lamps, many
of which are to be seen in our museums. In Fig. 75
is shown a Japanese ritual vase, intended for wine
(<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">hu</i>); it is of square shape, with cover of Kwei and
dragon pattern, animal feet and bosses on the shoulders,
and bird-shaped arris on the lid, the inside of which
is inscribed with twelve characters; the patina of this
vessel ranges from deep brown to bright malachite-green.
Fig. 76 is a smaller ritual vessel, with two
handles at the shoulder and one meander band and
knob. The vase shown in Fig. 77, with dragon
handles, a beautifully patinated specimen, shading
from brown to red with green accretions, is a ritual
<i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">tsui</i> or vase for offering corn. These remarkable
relics formed part of a large collection dispersed
recently at a well-known London salesroom. Now
and then less important pieces come under the
hammer, and it is by no means difficult to secure for
a small outlay an excellent representative collection
of these deeply interesting objects associated with
idol worship.</p>

<p class="chapblock">Outside influences&mdash;Benin bronzes&mdash;Other African curios.</p>


<p>There are few collections of copper and brass
without a fair sprinkling of curiously formed and
often crude objects which we class under the generic
term "native curios." There is much that is of
extreme interest in the work of the smiths and
founders of races possessing but little apparent touch
with civilized nations; for such metal objects are
true guides to the state of the advancement of the
peoples of the countries from which such curios
come. We delight in the art of early Eastern
nations, and find much to admire in the almost
barbaric ornament of Asiatic metal-workers of
medi√¶val and even later days, as counted by the
progress made by European artists at contemporary
dates. The marvellous skill with which the natives
of India and other Asiatic countries incised and
inlaid their metal wares has already been pointed
out. There is, however, an especial charm about
the metal-work of nations we are apt to class as
"savage," or at least untutored, if not uncivilized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
And we would not have it otherwise, for it is from
these curios&mdash;metal and of other materials&mdash;that we
are enabled to trace the influences of other countries
with whom those races or tribes have had dealings
in the past. We are to some extent able from these
antiquities to connect the links in the chain of
nations, and from the characteristics of their art (?)
to settle their origin and affinity to other races.</p>


<h3>Outside Influences.</h3>

<p>The Ethnological Gallery of the British Museum
is one of the finest instructors. The silent exhibits
tell the observant man or woman, boy or girl, much
that cannot be learned from book knowledge. In
the cases in that gallery are many objects fashioned
by peoples who until recently were in their Stone
Age, and had no knowledge of the outer world.
There are some who from the curios&mdash;old and new&mdash;have
apparently, until taught their use by travellers
and traders from the far-off West, never discovered
the value of metals. Some of the native races&mdash;not
a few of them fellow-subjects of the Empire&mdash;as yet
prefer wood, stone, and crude pottery vessels and
utensils to metal, judging from the very limited use
of the few brass or copper objects they possess, those
few, probably, being imported. The ethnology of
the race is traced in these relics, especially in the
really old ones. In a few instances by way of contrast,
metal objects, although so limited, are conspicuous.
They are chiefly confined to the native
countries brought under the influence of more
advanced peoples; as instanced by the work of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Sinhalese, the natives of Ceylon, who early came into
touch with the metal-workers of India. Another
native race by their wealth of rare metallic curios,
the art of producing which they have lost, are shown
to be a people with a past; thus it is with the tribes
of Southern Nigeria in and around Benin City. On
the occasion of its capture by the British in 1897,
it was found to possess a remarkable store of wonderful
bronzes, evidently of the sixteenth or seventeenth
centuries. In these and other native curios the
collector revels, and in their study finds history,
geography, and even the folk-lore of nations revealed;
for in such curios there are stories in brass of social
life, religious functions, ceremonies, and sacrifices.</p>


<h3>The Benin Bronzes.</h3>

<p>A few years ago very many bronzes (nearly pure
copper) were sold under the hammer. They were
looted from Benin City during the war which ended
in the country in and around the city being taken
by the British troops, and eventually incorporated in
Southern Nigeria. These wonderful bronzes throw
a light upon the history of that country, and tell
of a powerful nation far advanced in the art of
modelling and casting metals long before they had
come into close touch with Western influence. This
remarkable people who possessed so much wealth
in copper and in ivory have long gone; their descendants
or the tribes occupying their city have no
knowledge of the craft, and apparently retained these
relics of barbaric splendour with silent awe. The
entire series of bronze panels from which the figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
so cleverly stand out in bold relief, must have
presented a wonderful sight to the British soldiers
as they entered Benin. The collection in the British
Museum was sent home to this country by Sir Ralph
Moor, K.C.M.G., H.M. Commissioner and Consul-General
for the Niger Coast Protectorate. It is
impossible to describe their beauty or the details of
the elaborate modelling of the dress, arms, and
costumes of the Benin king and his chiefs and officers
as they existed in the sixteenth century. There is
a model of the king's house, his attendant guards,
high officials, a sword-bearer, and another bearing a
ceremonial axe. Some of the bronzes represent
musicians playing various instruments, and others
performing all kinds of functions. The bronze
panels of fishes and animals are very lifelike,
especially bulls, crocodiles, and the heads of oxen,
even the twisted cords with which the animals were
tethered being correctly modelled. The bronzes
representing Europeans are exceptionally valuable
in that from the costumes portrayed the date of
those bronzes has been fixed, approximately. The
matchlocks and flint-guns are reproduced with the
greatest exactitude, as also the Egyptian figures,
copied presumably from the remains of Ancient
Egypt, with which these metal-workers were evidently
familiar.</p>

<p>In addition to the panels of copper, which show
marks of how they were attached to the walls, were
bronze masks or warriors' heads which served as
stands for the splendidly carved tusks of ivory also
discovered when the expedition visited that country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
There are many minor objects in bronze which show
that this remarkable civilization, now lost, was far
advanced in the arts.</p>

<p>As it has been suggested Benin relics are not
entirely confined to museum specimens, and collectors
are not without opportunities of securing pieces.</p>

<p>Many of the early tribes of Africa had knowledge
of metal-working, although some have lost or
neglected to practice it.</p>


<h3>Other African Curios.</h3>

<p>Some metal curios were included in the trophies
brought to this country at the time of the Ashanti
Expedition, among the rare regal metal-work being
an old brass vase, with repouss√© decorations and a
copper dragon handle. It was discovered behind
the house of King Prempeh's aunt, who had been
acting as Regent. Another curio discovered in the
same district was a brass box containing gold dust.
Bells, too, have been brought from Ashanti; one in
the British Museum is the executioner's bell, which
was rang prior to an execution.</p>

<p>There are many bronzes from Southern Nigeria,
especially some curious ornaments worn by the
women. Some of these are veritable antiques and
were found buried; many are finely patinated and
heavy. Some of the bangles are beautifully formed
and highly decorated with inlaid enamels.</p>

<p>Some very interesting brass castings come from
Lagos, not at all unlike the Benin modelling, except
that they are in brass instead of pure copper. They
include figures of natives, some on horseback, others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in the act of shooting with guns. There are brass
staves of office carried as symbols of authority by
the messengers of the Oshogbo, a native secret
society; and there are spoons, knives and other
domestic sundries, as well as armlets and anklets
of copper and brass.</p>

<p>From north-east Central Africa we get a little
metal-work, some of the head-dress ornaments
being enriched with circular brass plates, on which
are repouss√© decorations. Among the curios from
this district in the British Museum are several exceptional
pieces, one being a head-dress or helmet
of brass with circular brass ornaments.</p>

<p>The knives used in ceremonials are often very
handsome. There is a fine executioner's knife from
north-east Central Africa, with brass studs all over
the wood handle. Another chief's knife, which came
from near the Stanley Falls, is decorated with strips
of copper and brass.</p>

<p>The metal castings from Central Sudan, representing
ostriches, giraffes, and camels, are cleverly
done, and with bangles and anklets make up an
interesting group.</p>

<p>It is curious how valuable finds are sometimes
made many miles from the locality where the object
was made. It is the same in our own country, for
we dig and find a bronze from ancient Rome,
brought over by the conquering armies of the
Romans when Britain was brought under the
Imperial sway. Our armies have probably left
relics behind them in the past as in the present,
for it is no uncommon thing for reminders of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Crusaders and others to be found even in Africa.
One of the most remarkable finds was a large
bronze jug and cover now in the British Museum;
on it are the arms of Richard II of England, and
two mottoes in Lombardic letters: <span class="f75">"HE THAT WILL
NOT SPARE WHEN HE MAY, HE SHALL NOT SPEND
WHEN HE WOULD"</span> is one; the other reads: <span class="f75">"DEEM
THE BEST IN EVERY DOUBT TILL THE TRUTH BE
TRIED OUT."</span> This splendid jug was found in
Ashanti; the date of its manufacture was about
<span class="f75">A.D.</span> 1400.</p>

<p>The South African curios in brass are very
limited; they consist chiefly of collars and armlets
worn by the women of Basutoland and Bechuanaland,
and by the Kaffir women who have also
girdles of brass cleverly formed.</p>

<p>Although by no means numerous and of limited
variety, a few objects of native workmanship are
worth securing if only to compare the way in which
natural ingenuity has at different times helped the
craftsman and enabled him to work even metals
without any instructions from nations more advanced
in their use.</p>

<span class="ph3">CONTINENTAL COPPER AND BRASS</span></h2>

<p class="chapblock">Italian bronzes&mdash;French art&mdash;Dutch brasswork&mdash;German metal-work.</p>


<p>The Italian renaissance in art exercised such a
wide influence upon manufactured goods in this
and other countries that the collector of antiques
naturally turns to the achievements of the artists
in metal who worked in Florence and Rome for
the highest ideals he can seek. In this he is
not disappointed, for just as the connoisseur of
ancient art finds his delight in the bronzes of
Greece and Rome, the collector of more modern
art sees grace and beauty combined with skilful
grouping in Italian craftsmanship. European influence
has been brought to bear upon the metal-work
of the world at different times, but it has
not always come from the same country. At
different periods the metal-workers of certain localities
appear to have made their peculiar characteristics
take precedence of others. In most of the
European countries quite distinct styles and even
unique treatment of metals have been noticeable;
so much so that our museums to-day contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
groups of metal-work having little or no affinity
to one another, although coming, perhaps, from
towns not far removed in point of geographical
position. The collector recognizes as distinct the
bronzes of Italy; the screens, candlesticks, and
ecclesiastical metal-work of Spain; the beaten
bronze, champlev√© enamels, and the decorative brass
of the Empire period of France; the eighteenth-century
Dutch brasswork; the metal forged and
cast in Germany, and the decorative copper and
brass of Turkey showing such distinctly Oriental influence
in Saracenic touch. To study all these rival
styles at their best the collector, however large his
private collection, must perforce visit either one of
the more important Continental museums or the
Victoria and Albert Museum at South Kensington,
where so many cases are filled with Continental
works of art in gold, silver, and the baser metals.
Local museums rarely possess a selection large
enough for comparative purposes. The loan exhibits
from the national collection, carefully selected
as representative specimens, are very helpful, and
many such loan cases strengthen local exhibits and
add interest to them. In the United States of
America public museums are well arranged with
the view of showing the metal-work of different
countries at varied periods, and many of them are
peculiarly rich in exhibits of domestic metal-work
which was taken over in the early days from Europe.</p>

<p>As a guide to curators and others wishful to
secure the right kind of exhibits it may be useful
to mention the contents of a case on view at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
South coast town public library recently. There
were some beautiful Italian bronzes of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, a damascened candlestick
from Venice, a Florentine statuette, a handsome
cabinet handle chased with foliated ornament, a
bronze mask of Pan, a table lamp stand with
winged lions at the base, and a handsome ewer,
the body of which was ornamented with foliage,
around it figures representing the triumph of
Bacchus, a typical seventeenth-century specimen.
Among the minor objects in that case were vases
from many countries, door knockers, and a few
examples of Dutch metal-work, decorative and
artistic.</p>


<h3>Italian Bronzes.</h3>

<p>The metal-workers from the sixth to the tenth
centuries, when so many decorative bronzes were being
made for St. Peter's and Italian churches, derived
their inspirations from Byzantium, hence those
early works were often inlaid with silver and gold,
and were quite different from those of later date.
Art developed, and gradually a more distinctive
character was given to the bronze gates and
candelabra which were made with such consummate
skill. One of the greatest triumphs of that
period was the great candelabrum in Milan Cathedral,
wrought in the thirteenth century. Its height
is 14 ft., and it has seven branches for candles,
the stem being supported by four winged dragons.
It is one mass of marvellous scrollwork, relieved
by the introduction of figures, each one of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
is perfect in itself&mdash;a study of expression and character.
Casts of these remarkable pieces of metal-work
may be seen at South Kensington.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
Florentine artists worked. It was then that
statues in bronze were sculptured by Verrocchio,
Donatello, and others. A century later the wonderful
candlesticks in the Certosa, near Pavia, and
in the cathedral at Padua, were made. It was
about that time that Venetian metal-workers were
fashioning so much that was beautiful in domestic
utensils and the minor church ornaments.</p>

<p>From that time onward collectable brasses were
made, and after long years of use they passed into
the category of antiques, rendered beautiful by their
artistic merits, and possibly by the touch of age.
Even then there was an Oriental look about many
of the designs, but it seldom intrudes, and does
not spoil the effect of the forms and style so clearly
Venetian. Such vessels were chiefly made for the
then wealthy merchants of the city, and often their
arms were incorporated into the design. Fig. 78 is
a bronze oviform ewer made in Venice about 1530.
Another beautiful vase is shown in Fig. 79. Other
objects much favoured were candlesticks, hand-warmers,
and perfume sprinklers, to which must
be added the more strictly utilitarian.</p>

<p>The Spanish metal-workers do not appear to have
developed a very well-defined school of metallic art
of their own. They were especially noted for their
highly ornamental jewellery; in the common metals
they were influenced by Italy, and to some extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Germany. It is said that the finest piece of work
accomplished in the country was the great sixteenth-century
candelabrum or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tenebrarium</i> in
Seville Cathedral, the work of Bart. Morel in 1562.</p>


<h3>French Art.</h3>

<p>Connoisseurs of the fine arts naturally regard
enamels of Limoges as the greatest achievements
of the country (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a>). There is, however,
much to admire in the early unadorned metal-work,
especially that made in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries&mdash;effigies in beaten copper,
some portions of which were usually adorned by
coloured "champlev√©" enamel. They were afterwards
desired by Englishmen, and some good
examples of "imported" effigies are to be seen, a
notable example being one on the tomb of William
de Valence in Westminster Abbey, erected about
1296. Of domestic metal-work there are not many
early pieces. In Fig. 82 is shown a cup or ewer of
brass with artistic handle and spout ornamented with
a grotesque mouth; the date assigned to it is 1570.
It may be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum,
where also is deposited a fine seventeenth-century
ewer or tankard with plain cylindrical body and a
deep and long spout with fancy handle (see <a href="#Page_324">Fig. 81</a>).
There is also a trumpet of brass, dated 1738, in the
same gallery; it has upon it the owner's monogram,
"<span class="f75">S.M.A.</span>," ensigned with a count's coronet and crest.</p>


<h3>Dutch Brasswork.</h3>

<p>The brasswork from Holland, largely imported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
into this country at the commencement of the
eighteenth century, although decorative, cannot be
claimed as artistic. Most of the objects are strictly
utilitarian, and the ornament stiff and formal; they
were hammered by hand, an effective finish being
made by small punches, repouss√© work being occasionally
added. Fig. 80, which represents one of
the larger pieces, illustrates a highly ornamental
cistern with cover and tap. Its shape is semicircular,
a dome-shaped back acting as a hanger;
that as well as the perforated grille under the
cistern being ornamented. The chief ornament
consists of star devices, the points of which are
united together by curved lines composed of small
straight indentations. In the Victoria and Albert
Museum there is a Dutch foot-warmer, the sides
of which are ornamented with repouss√© panels of
flowers and circular bosses; in the centre of the
top, which is slightly curved, is a medallion engraved
"<span class="f75">I.W.H.M.</span> 1733," surrounded by open-work
decoration and floral scrolls arranged in geometrical
patterns, on either side of which are birds.</p>

<p>The brass milkcans used by modern milk sellers,
and the beautifully ornamented churns and milk
perambulators seen in some neighbourhoods, are
not altogether new or the outcome of modern advertisement.
In Holland brass ornament has been
used on tinware for many years, and some very
quaint old milkcans and dairy utensils in shining
polished brass are met with by collectors who visit
Holland. The milkcans of that country, or perhaps
more correctly large bowls, in which milk and cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
are served have double handles, and make extremely
handsome flower-bowls or fern-pots on
the table, although perhaps collectors would consider
such a desecration an improper use for a
genuine antique. Many of the chestnut roasters,
skimmers, and brass chimney ornaments used in
England in the eighteenth century came from
Holland. The artists of that country were famous
for the characteristic Dutch scenes engraved on
their metal-work, just as they were for their tiles
with quaint windmills and pictures of peasants in
native costume on them. So famous has the collection
of these brasses become that much modern
metal-work, copies of genuine antiques, has been
sent over for sale in London curio-shops. Some
of these reproductions are excellent copies; others
are "too new" and would scarcely deceive the
amateur. Caution should be observed, especially
when buying "old time" fire-brasses, knockers and
trivets.</p>


<h3>German Metal-Work.</h3>

<p>Curios, as well as modern antiques "made in
Germany," are not always labelled as such; there is,
however, a distinctly German look about old metal-work
from that country. Elaborate and massive with
its wealth of floral embellishment, some of the
German metal-work of early days stands out conspicuously.
Some elaborate cast bronze gates and
door furniture enriched the churches of the eleventh
and twelfth centuries. Augsburg and Nuremberg
have always been famous centres for artistic metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
work, and in those towns many objects large and
small have been made. Among minor works are the
very handsome lock plates and cases. The shapes
of domestic utensils, especially of ewers, were very
quaint. There is a German aquamanile or ewer in
the form of an animal, embodying a lion and stag,
along with several others equally as curious, in the
British Museum. Nuremberg contributes to our
national collection a variety of hand wash-basins
in brass; the earlier examples being richly ornamented
with engravings typifying different virtues
and vices; St. George, the patron saint of England,
also figures on some pieces. Turkish metal-work
includes copper ewers, chased and decorated with
enamels, mostly with handles and spouts, some of
the sets or pairs consisting of ewer (<em>ibrik</em>) and
basin (<em>tisht</em>). These copper vessels are sometimes
embossed with scale ornaments. There are braziers
and some vessels of bulbous form, mostly of bronze,
and now and then Turkish collapsible lanterns of
brass with pierced decorations are met with.</p>

<p class="chapblock">The mystery of dialling&mdash;Some old dials&mdash;Antique clocks&mdash;Old watches&mdash;The
weather&mdash;Scientific instruments.</p>


<p>The modern man can scarcely realize what it must
have been in this England of ours when clouds
obscured the sun, and thick mists drew a veil over
the shadow cast by the gnomon, before clocks were
known. The time of day was of less importance
when the sundial on the church tower, or on a pillar
erected at some convenient place, had to be consulted,
when the sun shone it is true, but even then many
must have inwardly fretted and rebelled against the
uncertainty. Reader, have you ever spent a day
away from public clocks in the country when the
sky was overcast <em>without a watch in your pocket</em>?
If not, do it now, and the result will be startling.
It will create a sympathetic touch with the past,
and bring vividly to mind the trials of patience which
had to be endured when under such conditions inscriptions
on dials were read, but no clear line marked
the onward march of Sol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Mystery of Dialling.</h3>

<p>Dialling is a science which few except experts
understand now; the antiquary takes little note
of it as he gazes upon the old dial plate and makes
out the inscription upon it. The collector gladly
buys the brass dial with its quaint lettering and
division marks without even knowing where it came
from, or what kind of stone column or pillar it
originally capped. Yet there is far more interest
in an old sundial installed in a modern garden
amidst reconstructed old-world surroundings when
the origin of the relic is known.</p>

<p>We have no record of the type of sundial referred
to in Isaiah xxxviii, 8: "Behold, I will bring again
the shadow of the degrees which is gone down on
the <em>sun-dial</em> of Ahaz, ten degrees backward." There
are, however, records of the sundial of the Chaldean
astronomer Perosus, who lived about 340 <span class="f75">B.C.</span> It
consisted of a hollow hemisphere placed with its
rim horizontal, having a head or globule fixed so that
as long as the sun shone above the horizon the shadow
of the head fell on the inside of the hemisphere.</p>

<p>In more recent days the making and fixing of
the dial with its gnomon was carried out on fixed
principles, and there is now no difficulty about such
an installation provided that the same astronomical
conditions are observed. (For rules governing dialling,

<h3>Some Old Dials.</h3>

<p>The pattern known as the garden dial is that commonly
met with (for the large dials once fixed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
church towers and in public places rarely come into
the market); and the old dial plates seen in curio-shops
have come from such pillars. Charles Dickens
had a fine old sundial in his garden at Gad's Hill
Place, and it has often been copied. The globe dial,
set on suitable pillars, has been made frequently for
modern antique gardens. An enterprising maker of
dials purchased the beautiful balustrades of old Kew
Bridge when it was removed a few years ago, and
capping them with replicas of old dials&mdash;in some
cases with genuine antiques&mdash;produced excellent
examples of the old type of garden sundial. Similar
dials, more imposing in size, are met with in curious
and yet very suitable places by motorists, cyclists,
and others when touring in the country. A charming
Elizabethan relic is the stone bridge across the
River Wye in the village of Wilton, near Ross. On
the north wall of the parapet is a stone pillar
surmounted by a sundial having four faces&mdash;an interesting
landmark and often admired; and when
the sun shines on it the traveller invariably pulls out
his watch and compares it with the shadow of the
gnomon. There were once many famous dials <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>
in London; most of them are gone; there are some,
however, readily seen, like the noted pillar dial in
the Temple and that on the front of one of the
old buildings in Lincoln's Inn.</p>

<p>Of other forms of dials, the eccentricities of the
horologists they might be called, there are the
"goblet" dials in the form of a cup, the hour-lines
being engraved on the interior; pillar dials which
are cylinders with movable gnomons; the quadrant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
in the use of which the altitude of the sun is taken
through pierced sights, the time being shown on
curved hour-lines by means of a plumb-line hanging
from the angle; and the ring dials, which were very
popular in England down to the year 1800. In
Fig. 83 are shown earlier dials of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. On the left there is an armillary
dial by F. Culpeper, of London. In the middle
there is a pillar dial dated 1567, and on the right
of the figure a ring dial made by Humphrey Cole
in 1575, all three important types. Perhaps one
of the chief delights of the study of sundial plates
is to read and make out the different mottoes and
legends on them&mdash;most of them relating to the flight
of time, some alluding to man's duties which, when
neglected, can never be made up, for "Time and
tide wait for no man."</p>

<p>Another type of dial is the portable one, in which
form dials or pocket clocks, as they were sometimes
called, can be collected&mdash;and they are generally of
brass, some being very decorative.</p>


<h3>Antique Clocks.</h3>

<p>There is no intermediate stage between the general
use of clocks and watches and sundials, for their
use overlaps. We have but to look at many an
old church tower on which is to be seen the dial
still operative&mdash;for sun and gnomon fail not&mdash;and
the clock which has told the time for many years.
Both were probably working before pocket clocks
or watches became general and timepieces were to
be found on the mantelpiece or sideboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>Brass was used from the commencement of clockmaking
for wheels and dials; and wonderfully, too,
the early clockmakers cut and carved the metal into
the required form and gauged the works with accuracy.
Some may be familiar with that wonderful
astronomical clock in Wimborne Minster, made in
1220 by Peter Lightfoot, a monk of Glastonbury,
who also constructed a clock for Wells Cathedral.
In it, according to the early belief that the sun, moon,
and stars revolved round the earth, the sun travels
its appointed circuit every twenty-four hours, and
by its position marks the time.</p>

<p>In the evolution of the clock there have been many
marked stages. The clock when first devised was
a great stride from the sundial, the beautiful plates
of which have already been described. Progress
followed, and in a century or two clocks with wheels
and complicated mechanism, which when once set
going and wound up periodically told the time
with exactitude, enabled the populace to know the
time of day even when the sun was not shining.
That was the age of decorative art, and many of
the brass plates and dials were magnificent in their
engravings, glorious in their beautiful old fretwork,
and rich in brass cherubims and emblems of Old
Father Time. Moving figures were in the early
days regarded as ideal attractions in clocks. The
two old figures which strike the hour and go through
some quaint evolutions over the clock which for
many years has been a great attraction in Cheapside,
are typical of the figures which in miniature might
have been seen playing on brass gongs and chiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
bells in many towns in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. They were in abundance in Norwich and
towns in the eastern counties, seeming to reflect
the old Flemish cities on the Continent, where they
are even now fairly common. Collectors are very
enthusiastic in their search for genuine "Cromwell"
or lantern clocks. A few years ago they might have
been found discarded on the old metal rubbish-heaps
of the clockmaker. To-day these clocks, all brass
in their construction, are polished bright, set going
once more, and treated with care; good specimens
changing hands for sums varying from eight to fifteen
pounds. Originally they were usually placed on a
bracket, over which was often a wooden hood to protect
the clock. Then came a hinged glass door,
and in that we have the origin of the "grandfather"
with enlarged dial and rich oak or mahogany case
reaching down to the ground.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a></span></p>

<p>Those who wish to study the beautiful dials and
engraved faces of clocks and watches in order that
they may realize the difference in the products of
makers during the last few centuries, should visit
the splendid collection in the Guildhall Museum,
loaned by the Clockmakers' Company. The work
of the old clockmakers was that of the very best.
It was made to last, and the metal they chose for
their operations appears to have been very suitable
for the purpose. In evidence of the lasting quality
of old brass works, a well-known writer has put
forward the interesting story of a chamber clock
presented by Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn on their
wedding day. It found its way into the Strawberry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Hill collection of Horace Walpole, and at the famous
sale of those interesting curios and souvenirs of great
persons that noted minister had gathered together,
it was purchased for ¬£100 by the late Queen Victoria.
Harrison Ainsworth says: "This token of endless
affection remains the same after three centuries; but
four years after it was given, the object of Henry's
eternal love was sacrificed on the scaffold. The
clock still goes, but surely it should have been
stopped for ever when Anne Boleyn died!"</p>

<p>The advent of table clocks came with the discovery
of the use of a mainspring by the Nuremberg clockmakers
in the sixteenth century. In the British
Museum there is a clock in the form of a ship made
for the Emperor Rudolph II in 1581. There are many
other fine examples of curiously designed clocks,
including a water clock by Finchet, of Cheapside,
and a French astronomical clock with astrolabe, and
others with automatic figures on view there, as well
as very remarkable types in the collection of clock
dials and watches given to the Museum by the
late Mr. Octavius Morgan.</p>

<p>The early clocks, the dials of which were of brass,
had only one finger, for the minute-hand was not
known until 1670, and the second finger a much
later invention.</p>

<p>In Fig. 85 is a typical example of a brass engraved
watch clock face and dial, which has a perforated
hinged cover and is exceptionally well engraved.</p>


<h3>Old Watches.</h3>

<p>Watches were costly in the days when so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
time was expended on their manufacture. Those
were the days of good workmanship in which watchmakers
excelled. They put much labour into the
ornamentation of the works, "watch-clocks," and dial
plates, so many of which were beautifully engraved,
tooled with great skill, and cleverly perforated. The
dials were in early days unprotected, hence the need
of a case, often of brass, and when made of some
other material were frequently ornamented with brass
inlay. It was not until the middle of the seventeenth
century that glass or crystal covers were
invented; that was about the time, too, when the
enamelling of dials came into vogue.</p>

<p>The pocket watch brought with it fobs, chains,
and watch-keys or winders, mostly of brass, which
should not be overlooked. In a representative collection
there are crank keys similar to large clock
winders, but, of course, made in miniature. Then
after various developments brass and Pinchbeck fob
keys came into vogue, and later still ornamental
keys with and without the addition of stones, the
majority being made in brass. A number of these
little objects can still be collected quite cheaply, and
nicely mounted make a very interesting addition to
the more ornamental side of brass metal-work.</p>


<h3>Forecasting the Weather.</h3>

<p>The weather has found men a subject for discussion
and given them opportunities of speaking a pleasant
word of comradeship when meeting in the country
or in town. To comment upon its fickleness has
become as common a mode of salutation as passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the time of day. The topic is an ancient one and
the interest in it has been sustained, for to gauge
the coming changes has taken the attention of men
from the earliest times. To study the fleeting cloud,
to note the coming storm by the direction of the
wind, or to notice the damp in the air as the mist
rises and is wafted over the fields, has always been
a favourite occupation. It was so before the day
of barometers and scientific instruments, and it is
equally so by those who prefer the pronouncement
of the weather prophet rather than the barometer
gauge. Galileo is said to have invented the thermometer,
but it was his pupil Torricelli, who discovered
the barometer. His townsmen in Faenza,
in the north of Italy, some years ago erected a
monument to his memory, putting up the biggest
barometer known. In common with other scientific
instruments the barometer has afforded opportunities
to the worker in metal and to the art designer,
for like the clock case it has been made a thing of
beauty as well as one of use. The very remarkable
barometer illustrated in Fig. 86 is an elaborate
work of the brassfounder and exceedingly ornate.
It is a very exceptional piece, but there are other
barometers of considerable beauty in the hands of
collectors of old bronze and metal-work.</p>

<p>Some of the old scientific instruments are very
clumsy looking when compared with modern workmanship.
About them it is true there is a quaint
beauty and a silent tribute to the skill and ingenuity
of early inventors, those who were but groping, perhaps
blindly, in the initial stages of an undeveloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
science. Scientists always take a delight in the
instruments which their predecessors have used, and
when they realize by comparison the difficulties the
early pioneers had to contend with on account of
the inefficient instruments in their possession they
wonder at the advance that particular science made
in their day.</p>

<p>In Fig. 84 we illustrate a curious old microscope
and case, made about the year 1780. It is on a
mahogany stand, in which is a drawer containing
four magnifying powers. It formerly belonged to
a Mr. Charles Sherborne and is now in the Hull
Museum, where, as the connecting link between the
older type and the modern, there is another interesting
microscope made some fifty or sixty years ago. The
engineer, mechanic, and scientist find much pleasure
in the curios which were associated with their professions
in former days, and delight in the possession
of "old brass" which seems to bring them nearer to
the great men who years ago laid the foundations on
which present-day advance has been built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a></span></p>

<p>Engineers have been very skilful in creating models
of engines and machinery with which they have been
familiar, and in reproducing in miniature replicas of
noted engines which have been used for practical
purposes. These little models, some of which were
made more than a hundred years ago, in days when
steam power was but in its infancy, have been very
valuable to engineers to-day, in that they provide them
with actual models of old-time engines, the details of
construction of which might otherwise have been lost.
In one of the museums at South Kensington there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
are many of these scientific and mechanical models in
brass, some of them working on the penny-in-the-slot
principle, so that visitors can by the expenditure of a
few coppers set in motion any machine they are interested
in, and so judge of the actual effects of old-time
inventions as illustrated by models which have
been made to scale.</p>

<p>In addition to working models of large objects
there are some remarkably small models which are
stored and treasured by collectors. Some are so
small and minute, although perfect in every detail,
that it is difficult to understand how the worker in
brass even if he had been a jeweller and accustomed
to fashion the settings of small stones could so accurately
have produced such tiny machines. It is
said that the smallest engine in the world, a beautiful
piece of metal-work, owned by an American collector,
stands on a ten-cent piece! Yet remarkable as it
may seem, when connected with an electric power
cable of very small calibre the engine starts off as
if it were a full-size horizontal engine. The chief
materials used in the construction are copper and
brass, although the band of the fly-wheel is of solid
gold. So small is this little engine that its measurements
are all taken in sixty-fourths of an inch. Thus
the diameter of the fly-wheel, practically the largest
piece of mechanism in the construction of the engine,
is 28/64 in., and the fly-wheel band only 7/64 in. The
valve rod is only 1/64 in., and the outside diameter of
the cylinder 12/64 in.; completed, standing on the small
coin referred to, the engine weighs 3 dwt., a truly
remarkable work of metallic art.</p>

<span class="ph3">ENAMELS ON COPPER</span></h2>

<p class="chapblock">Processes of enamelling&mdash;Chinese and Japanese enamels&mdash;British
enamels.</p>


<p>Copper has been used frequently as the most suitable
metal to coat over with enamels, to be afterwards fired
or fixed. Even the ancients discovered the art of
colouring the metal-work they had wrought by the
aid of different enamels more or less translucent.
Such substances were used in varied forms, often
as paste, filling up incised designs, the workmen in
some cases rubbing them down smooth when fixed,
in others firing them by heat or simply heating
until they ran smoothly over the surface of the
metal to which they adhered. The enamels which
are to be obtained vary in substance, the beauty of
their workmanship, and in their rarity and curio
values. They cover the entire period of known art
and although such enamels are widely distributed,
the art of enamelling having been practised in almost
all countries where art has flourished, some have won
greater fame than others, many of these rare types<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
being easily distinguished by characteristic forms,
colours, or designs.</p>

<p>Among the earlier exponents of enamelling were
the Egyptians, the early Greeks, and to some extent
the Romans. It would appear that enamelling was
understood, too, in England, and was early practised
as a British art, but it soon died out, to be restored
again in this country under more favourable
circumstances in the greater renaissance of medi√¶val
art.</p>

<p>The enamels which have attained such great fame,
and which are so keenly appreciated by connoisseurs,
are those made at Limoges in Southern France, and
again to a lesser extent in Italy and the Rhenish
Provinces. Two beautiful examples of twelfth-century
pricket candlesticks, now in the British Museum,
are of that early form which, except for ecclesiastical
purposes, soon gave way to the socket candlestick,
a more convenient form for domestic use.</p>


<h3>Processes of Enamelling.</h3>

<p>The basis of most of the enamels on copper
is a fusible silicate, or colourless glass mixed with
metallic oxides, reduced to a fine powder, which is
applied according to the skill of the artist. The
metal, with the enamel powder upon it, is then fired
until it is melted and adheres to the metal. The
different treatments help the expert to distinguish
the period when a specimen under investigation
was made, and to some extent the place of its
manufacture. There is the translucent enamel, which
shows up the design through the vitreous matter, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
method originally adopted in Italy. Another process
was that of applying different colours over an
incised pattern, the figures or pictures being usually
engraved in low relief. Coarser lines of engraving
were used on the copper basis of the early enamels
made at Limoges. Those of somewhat later date
may be distinguished by the surface-painted enamels
adopted in the later style, which flourished until about
1630. In this process dark enamel for the shadows
was placed over the metal plate, the picture being
painted in white with some portions in colour; a thin
enamel surface was then given and the whole fired.
The later surface-painted enamels were for the
most part copies of well-known paintings or engravings,
the colour or enamel being afterwards
fixed by firing. In the process of enamelling known
as champlev√© the design was cut into the metal, the
pattern or incisions made filled with colours, the
enamels being then fused; the basis was nearly
always of copper. The cloisonn√© enamel was generally
on a brass basis, and as in the more recent examples
from China and Japan, the cloisons or tiny cells of
metal were filled with the right and appropriate
colours; afterwards subjected to heat. In some cases
the metal foundation is in the centre and cloisons or
cells formed on either side of it. There is something
about the <em>old</em> enamels of this type besides the wear
and tear of centuries which distinguishes them from
the more modern, which, generally speaking, are
more brilliant in colouring, cruder and sharper in
design, and without that beautiful tone which is so
pleasing in the antique.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>


<h3>Chinese and Japanese Enamels.</h3>

<p>The rarer examples of Chinese art date back to the
beginning of the Ming period in 1368, continuing
until its close in 1643. The charm of these early
examples is at once recognizable when they are
compared with others of a later date. Fig. 87
represents a large Ming bowl florally decorated in
rich red, yellow, and white on a background of
cobalt blue outside and turquoise blue within.
Quite a different style of decoration is shown in
Fig. 88; the design of butterflies and gourd-vine
tracery being carried out in Pekin enamels in five
colours. This remarkably fine box, so charmingly
formed, contains a set of nine sweetmeat dishes, each
one bordered with bats of cobalt blue on a lighter
blue ground, on the cover of the outer box being
the Shu monogram. Another splendid piece, represented
in Fig. 89, is typical of a different style of
decoration. This fine bowl, also of the Ming period,
is florally enamelled, the inside showing the pattern
outlined by wire cloisons upon a white ground, the
flowers being worked in five colours. This bowl,
which is four inches high, is represented in the illustration
as standing on a beautifully carved stand of
about equal height. These choice pieces are illustrated
by the courtesy of Messrs. Glendining &amp; Co.,
Ltd., at whose well-known London auction rooms
they recently changed hands. The second great
period of Chinese art is that of the Ching Dynasty,
which commenced in 1644 and extended until more
recent times. While to some extent the art and the
decorative effect of that period was inferior to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
to-day, when judged from the present-day standard of
modern art, there was a rare beauty about the old
designs. The enamels of the Ching Dynasty were
carefully prepared and placed, and the colouring soft
and yet rich. The preparation of coloured matter by
experts of that period when the best ceramics of
China were made, has always been a subject of
admiration and wonder to the potters and enamellers
of more recent years. Examples of these charming
wares are not exceptionally rare, among the collectable
pieces being cups and bowls, exquisitely designed
kettles, tiers of boxes, water vessels, round
and oblong dishes, and incense burners. Some of
the bowls with covers are of quaint forms, a favourite
one being that of a peach. Vases of which the base
is enamel are often further enriched by ornaments
of copper-gilt. Among the rarer little curios seen
in a representative collection may be mentioned
small water droppers, mostly made in the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>The Ch'ien Lung period which followed extended
from 1736 to 1796, and included many candlesticks and
altar pieces as well as braziers, some of the copper
vessels being practically encrusted with enamels,
some of the finer ornamentation being attached
to the ground-work as additional or supplementary
decorative effects. As in the earlier periods much
labour was expended on the production of the many
fine temple sets which were presented to such uses.
The exceptionally fine altar set wrought in cloisonn√©
enamels, illustrated in Fig. 90, is of the Ch'ien Lung
period, and consists of a beautifully designed koro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
supported on legs in the form of tigers' heads, two
candlesticks 18 in. high, and a pair of vases. The
style of decoration is very rich, being turquoise
blue ground on which are floral designs in red,
green, dark blue, yellow, and other bright colours.
The pieces stand on brass-gilt foundations, which rest
on carved wooden stands, the set forming an extremely
interesting group, typical of the highest art
of the Ch'ien Lung period. There are many richly
ornamented and extremely valuable specimens of
more recent date admired by connoisseurs of art in
the galleries and curio-shops; but however beautiful
they are the collector of the older curios appraises
their values from a modern commercial standpoint,
and does not view them as he would antiques.</p>


<h3>British Enamels.</h3>

<p>It was not until the art of enamelling had been
perfected at Lill√® and other places on the Continent
of Europe, that an attempt was made to produce
similar trinkets and a few more important pieces,
such as candlesticks and inkstands, in this country.
The works established at Battersea by Mr. S. T.
Janssen about the middle of the eighteenth century
soon gained notoriety, and it was not long before the
enamels made there were eagerly sought after. In
addition to those articles mentioned, they consisted
chiefly of tea-canisters, snuff-boxes, spirit labels, and
patchboxes, the copper being coated over with an
opaque white enamel, which was coloured over and
then decorated with floral and other designs. Rose
tint afterwards became one of the favourite ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
colours at Battersea. Among the rarer examples
may be classed inkstands and writing-table appointments.
The inkstands usually include an ink-container,
a pen-box, and a sand or pounce pot,
for Battersea enamel inkstands were made before
blotting-paper was invented, and the wet ink,
chiefly applied with a quill pen, was dusted over
with pounce to prevent blotting, and when dry the
surplus was dusted off. The collector finds much
to interest in the little patchboxes of enamel, of
which there were many varieties. They remained
useful when the fashion of wearing patches declined,
for then they came in handy for cosmetics,
salves, and pomades. These curious little boxes
were frequently given by admirers and friends, as
may be imagined from the mottoes and sentimental
inscriptions upon them. Among the commoner
varieties seen in a collection are little oval boxes
on which are pictured two love-birds, sometimes
accompanied by a bird's nest. Others will have
imitations of needlework pictures, such as the fair
ones worked in those days. Sometimes a little
church is seen in the distance, and in the foreground
a boy and girl exchanging love-tokens. "This gift
is small, but love is all," is a favourite motto.
"Virtue fair, manners sweet, Together in my fair
one meet," are two oft-quoted lines, and another
favourite verse is:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse i0">"If you, my dear,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Accept of this,</div>
<div class="verse i0">Reward the giver</div>
<div class="verse i1">With a kiss."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>
<p>Some boxes, however, have evidently been the gifts
of those who could only claim "friendship" or
acquaintance with the recipient, for they bear such
sentiments as "A token of my respect," "Accept
this as a token of my esteem," and "Esteem the
giver." Some appear to have been made for sale
as place souvenirs, for they are inscribed "A trifle
from Bath," or other town where they had been
procured. Battersea portrait placques were made
between 1750 and 1760, among the favourite subjects
being the then Prince of Wales (afterwards
George IV), the Duke of Cumberland, and statesmen,
among whom Horace Walpole was evidently one of
the most popular.</p>

<p>English enamellers in other places, such as Bilston,
attained some fame, but the Battersea works held
their own, and not only produced the trinket boxes
and other toilet-table appointments referred to, but
many useful sundries, such as spirit and wine labels,
little trays, and the like. None of these, although
beautiful indeed, equalled the French enamels in the
delicate miniature paintings and scenes such as those
produced by the celebrated French painter, Petitot,
who gave much attention to the decoration of
exquisite toilet boxes and trinket trays.</p>

<p>The collectable curios in metal include many which
cannot be classified. They are isolated specimens
of copper and brasswork representing some special
household utensil or workshop appliance which, in
the course of time, has become obsolete or has been
superseded by more modern contrivances of other
materials. Copper was almost exclusively used in
works where acids and other chemicals prevented the
use of iron until enamelled wares, aluminium, and
zinc were available; but such workshop appliances
are not usually very attractive, and seldom come
within the scope of the collector except as museum
specimens. Among the various sundry objects of
interest, those mentioned in the following paragraphs
are worthy of notice, especially as many
of them are quite inexpensive, and can readily be
obtained from curio-shops and occasionally picked
up cheaply from cottages and farmhouses in out-of-the-way
places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>


<h3>Tobacco-boxes and Pipe-stoppers.</h3>

<p>Smokers' sundries include many objects in brass,
especially boxes for storing tobacco. Most of the
larger receptacles for the storage of tobacco were
in olden time of lead or pewter, or, in more recent
times, of japanned tin, followed in the present day
by pottery and wood. The small boxes in the days
before rubber pouches were known were nearly
always of brass or other metal, such boxes being
often elaborately ornamented. Dutch metal-workers
produced some very decorative boxes in the seventeenth
century. In some instances the sides are
made of copper and the covers or lids of brass,
the two metals in contrast presenting a very pleasing
appearance. Several of these boxes are to be seen
in the Guildhall Museum; on one there is the
representation of a bear-pit, on another scriptural
subjects, a third being more appropriately covered
with tavern scenes. Needless to say, Dutch artists
were then&mdash;as they have been in after years&mdash;famous
for their scenic views. The engravers appear to have
divided their favours between religious pictures and
rural scenes. Battles, too, came in for a share of the
engraver's skill, and such pictures are noticeable on
many of the larger boxes, some of which possibly
were not used as tobacco-boxes. The picture scenes
were continued until the close of the eighteenth
century, and in some instances a few years in the
next. Then there came a time of undecorated metal-work,
and the engraving, if any, was stiff and formal.
Ornamental borders came into vogue, and the more
elaborate boxes were engraved with the crests or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
monograms of their owners. Some show portraits,
such as an eighteenth-century box on which is a
portrait of Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>The metal-work so freely imported into this
country in the reign of William and Mary, and on
into the times of George III, of course included
many tobacco-boxes, but there are other pieces of
those periods, the uses of which are uncertain;
some of the long, narrow boxes were probably
made for spectacle-cases, and others as cases or
boxes for the money-changers' and traders' scales
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a>).</p>

<p>Ash-trays of copper and brass, among the fanciful
smokers' requisites of the present day, are by no
means novel, for among the antiques in metal are
found curious copper bowls with inverted feet and
wooden handles which were used by smokers in
the days when "churchwarden" pipes were mostly
smoked; they were known as smokers' ashes pans.</p>

<p>Tobacco-stoppers of metal are of early date, and
seem to have been regarded by metal-workers as
peculiarly suitable objects on which to display skill
in modelling and even engraving. An authentic
record of their use in Restoration days is met with
in a will referring to a bequest of Boscobel relics:
"The owner of an old oak box, dated 1660,
mentioned it as the 'one in which was a brass
tobacco-stopper.'" Of these curious and interesting
stoppers there are many varieties. Under Dutch
influence some striking characters were portrayed
as the ornamental heads of these pieces. In the
days of William and Mary they were chiefly cast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and afterwards tooled and even engraved. James II
was chosen as the model of many; and stoppers
with his bust as the handle were, it is said, treasured
by Jacobean admirers. The human hand in which
is seen a "churchwarden" pipe is a favourite type;
pugilists, too, figured, and others typified familiar
objects of local fame, even animals, birds, and
domestic utensils serving the purpose of the designer.
In recent days "Punch" has appeared, and among
the modern replicas of "early types" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</i>) to be seen
in the shops are sets of Dickens's characters as
tobacco-stoppers.</p>


<h3>Snuff-boxes.</h3>

<p>There are some of the so-called tobacco-boxes
which no doubt were in reality used only for snuff
in the days when snuff was taken in larger quantities
than it is to-day. A collection of snuff-boxes includes
many varieties, among which are some of metal.
Some of the boxes made of wood and of shagreen
are decorated with tiny brass studs, producing a
very pleasing effect. The snuff-boxes were shaped
according to popular fancy, and some of the more
eccentric patterns were local in their use. In
Scotland the curled-shaped mull was a favourite.
In connection with snuff-taking it must be remembered
that in the earlier days snuff as prepared
now was little known. Those addicted to the habit
had to prepare their own snuff. For that purpose
there came into vogue snuff-rasps of iron enclosed
in cases, which, although they were in some instances
of boxwood or carved pearwood, were now and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of metal. Incidentally this early home preparation of
the snuff produced from a small plug or twist of
tobacco gave rise to the popular trader's sign of the
"Crown and Rasp" over a tobacco shop. As
intimated in another chapter, many of the tobacco
and snuff-boxes served a dual purpose, and not
infrequently formed part of the tinder box, an
essential in early days.</p>


<h3>Handles and Handle-plates.</h3>

<p>The condition of the metal-work upon old
furniture and other curios is a factor in its beauty
and in its value too. The handles and handle-plates
should be of the same period as the antique,
and hinges, lock-plates, handles and their plates,
ball feet and castors should be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en suite</i>. Indeed,
it is better to substantiate a well-made reproduction
rather than to admit the use of a later style.
The want of harmony in the "brass furniture" of
antiques, although all portions appear old, is somewhat
puzzling at times. It is explainable in that
in early Victorian days when much that was then
old was repaired the village shopkeeper and even
the cabinet-maker had little regard for the preservation
of the old style. To restore meant to them
to repair, and where necessary to introduce the <em>then</em>
prevailing materials notwithstanding their obvious
inappropriateness.</p>

<p>Fortunately, dealers in antiques and restorers have
acquired nowadays a genuine love of their work,
and have learned how best to please their clients;
many of them having quite a store of odd handles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
and fittings for the curio-hunter and would-be
amateur restorer to choose from. To be quite
certain about getting a suitable style for the
restoration or repairs of old furniture it is desirable
to know something of the appropriate styles. The
drop handle is a foreign importation, for it is said
to have come from Japan, being first seen in this
country in the Oriental lacquer cabinets brought
here in the seventeenth century. Such handles were
at first pear-shaped, but they soon became larger
and of a type more adapted for drawers and the
heavier furniture then in use. Much hand labour
was expended upon their manufacture; even in the
latter part of the eighteenth century they were
filed up by hand. The earliest form of brass
handle-plate was the smooth and shiny "willow
brass," the edges of which were filed and shaped
by hand. Later they were distinguished from the
newer styles as "Queen Ann brasses." The handles
were fastened to the plates with brass-headed screw
bolts (in the commoner types the "plates" were
dispensed with). Chippendale and his followers
used an adaptation of the willow brass, placing
over the plain plate a fretwork grille or ornamental
plate of thin brass. Then came the bail handle
and the oval plate with beaded ornamentation,
adopted by Hepplewhite and Adams. In the meantime,
however, the drop and the bail were made
in a fancy design in keeping with Chippendale
"shells" and ornament. The rosette and ring handle
of the year 1800 and onwards is a feature to be
noticed, the round plate being pierced in the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
instead of at the sides as in the bail handle. The
ring which formed the handle hung from the central
screw. This got over the difficulty of the necessary
groove in which the old bail handle had fallen, and
allowed for a deeper projection and more ornamental
stamping. Such handles were in vogue in the
Empire period. There were heavier handles, too,
which often took the form of a lion's head instead
of an ornamental pattern, the ring hanging from
the mouth of the lion, these being often miniature
replicas of the brass door knocker. These beautiful
handles and the delightful brass knockers which
were used on furniture and doors concurrently gave
way to the ugly handles of the Victorian age, when
wood and glass knobs reigned supreme. It was a
sad picture of the decadence of popular taste, for
there can be no question as to the more artistic
and ornamental decorativeness of the brassfounder's
art over that of the wood-turner as exemplified by
the products of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>At the time when the different styles in furniture
decoration influenced brasswork, including handles,
knobs, lock-plates, and hinges, a gradual change
was going on in the castors used on furniture. The
square legs required a square-socketed castor; then
came the cabrioles or brass collars to the castors,
very ornamental and suitable to the style of the
shaped legs of mahogany furniture ornamented by
carving and curiously turned. The runners of the
castors were chiefly of brass and generally very
substantial. The brass wheels held sway until the
invention of the vitrified bowl, which seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
harmonize better with Victorian mahogany. In
restoration work the collector should see to it that
the castors used are in keeping with the furniture,
for if no genuine antiques are available there are
modern replicas of all the styles.</p>


<h3>Horse Trappings.</h3>

<p>Horse harness is heavily loaded with brass bands,
buckles, chains, and "trappings," many of the latter
appearing to be quite superfluous and unnecessary.
It would seem that the fanciful frets of perforated
brass were introduced from purely artistic motives.
That, however, is not quite correct, for even the
brass ornaments of to-day are chiefly replicas of more
ancient trappings, and although their forms may
have deviated somewhat, the ancient idea is quite
recognizable, and agriculturists and stablemen still
demand their retention. Such brasses, which now
make up so entertaining a collection, have meanings;
indeed, in the earlier examples the designs are true
to well-understood symbols which may or may not
in their use have a beneficial influence. To the
superstitious they are not merely trappings; they
are charms of real purpose (see <a href="#Page_371">Fig. 91</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="f75">FIG. 91.&mdash;COLLECTION OF BRASS AMULETS (HARNESS BRASSES).</span><br />
(<em>In the possession of Mr. Chas. Wayte, of Edenbridge.</em>)</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a></span></p>

<p>In all parts of the country there is a lingering
superstition which aids and abets the continuance
of the use of amulets. Indeed, the very general
belief in the protective value of symbols, the true
history and origin of which may have been forgotten,
is truly astonishing. One of the most remarkable
indications that old fables and beliefs, antedating
in their origin the introduction of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
religion in this country, have a hold still on rural
districts, is seen in the brass harness trappings used
by all classes alike. Years ago the makers of
harness fashioned their brasses with care, and the
artists who engraved them and cut them out of
solid plates of metal laboured long and tediously
in producing exact replicas of similar ornaments
which had been used from time immemorial. They
rarely deviated from the emblems they copied to
any material extent, although new designs were at
times added, based possibly on some specific local
emblem which was then gaining notoriety.</p>

<p>Then came the less expensive processes of reproduction
by casting and stamping, which multiplied
the designs and very often made them grotesque
in the eyes of experts and those who had been
accustomed to realize and understand a true meaning
in the designs they had been familiar with.</p>

<p>The ornamental brasses which hung in rows round
horses' necks, and conspicuously on the foreheads
or chests of the animals, deemed inseparable from
a set of harness in olden times, were regarded as
charms, protective against danger, accident, and, in
wilder times, perils unknown to-day.</p>

<p>These very pleasing objects in brass, which look
so handsome when polished and arranged on a cloth-covered
shield in the harness-room, or, perchance,
framed as a trophy for the hall or gun-room, are
so varied, and yet for the most part quite distinct,
that it is said nearly two hundred designs are
collectable. A complete set of brasses, as worn by
one horse properly harnessed, includes the face brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
already mentioned as the chief ornament on the
forehead, ear-brasses hanging behind the ears, three
brasses on each side of the shoulders, and ten martingale
(a strap passing from the horse's girth between
his forelegs) brasses for the breast. To trace their
purport and hence their forms it may be pointed
out that they are associated with the folk-lore of
the districts where they were originally used, and
were chiefly intended to keep off the "Evil Eye"
or calamity. They go back a long way into the
past, and are nearly all attributable to symbols
understood by the Saxons, early British, and still
older races. Their modern exponents are the
gypsies, and strange as it may seem, most of them
are either Buddhist, Egyptian, or Moorish. The
genuine antiques include such well-known emblems
as the crescent, the symbol brought back, it is said,
by the Crusaders from Eastern lands. The crescent
moon, like the horseshoe brass, is valued. There
are others showing the radiated sun's rays indicating
the sun worship of our ancestors. Conspicuous
among the floral emblems may be noticed the iris;
the lotus of Egypt is a common emblem, often
enclosed in a crescent-like form, occasionally met
with in a shield-like frame. There are the bull's
head with horns and the horse of the Saxon banner,
both essentially English types. Then there are clubs
and diamonds, hearts and spades, and many heathen
symbols. In a few instances brasses in the shape
of crosses are met with, but these are rare; possibly
they were introduced in the days of the Canterbury
pilgrims. In this connection may be related a pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
story of the good luck associated with the horseshoe,
which comes from Russia, where peasants
used to paint a picture of the Virgin Mary with a
golden halo round her head outside their doors to
protect them from harm. The snows and the rains
washed off the paint, but left the more lasting
gilding in the shape of the horseshoe. Hence it
is said the superstitious legend of the protective
power or good luck of the symbolical horseshoe,
or the crescent moon, is spread all the world over.
Another legend tells us how the Greeks and Romans
gave the world the crescent moon as an emblem
of good luck, so many thousands of replicas of
which have been fashioned in brass and used as
horse trappings by horsemen of all races. The
crescent moon was to those nations the symbol of
their loyalty to the huntress Diana, the goddess
they worshipped as a protector under many varied
conditions.</p>

<p>An exceptionally fine early brass of crescent form
is seen in South Kensington, where there are other
early specimens pointing to the ancient and very
general acceptance of the belief in the potency of
symbolical horse trappings as talismans against evil
and dangers of the road, happily unknown now.
Almost as common is the brass fashioned like the
sun god, whose face was so often looked upon with
awe by the ancients. Side by side with these pagan
symbols the emblems adapted by pilgrims in days
when Christianity had been made the religion of
the race can be seen to-day, still adorning the breast
of the horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>The amulet or charm is not altogether banished at
the present day. It has been worn at the watch
chain, round the neck, on a bangle, and suspended
from the chatelaine or the girdle. The greater use
of the road by motorist and cyclist has once more
brought into prominence the amulet or mascot,
carried in front of the rider. The river-girl places
a mascot on the prow of her boat, and the aviator
screws his mascot into position "for luck." Why
this should be done we cannot tell; the general belief
is in some mysterious advantage from the presence
of the mascot&mdash;an accepted theory by the sceptical
man who shakes his head and secretly marvels at
the folly of the belief.</p>

<p>Strange to say many of the present-day mascots
in brass&mdash;and that is the favourite metal&mdash;are
modelled upon amulets such as we have referred
to as finding their origin in pagan faiths. There
are others used by motorists, such as "C√¶sar," the
late King Edward's dog, the "Chantecler," and the
stag's head, which have no mystic meanings; on
the other hand, the most favoured are such brasses
as the "star and cresent" and the "rising sun" of
pagan worship of our ancestors, and "Mercury" the
Greek god.</p>

<p>The brass mascot used in every form, large and
small, by motorists and worn by many others so
extensively is the "Swastika" of Buddhist fame,
traceable in its varied form to Egyptian and other
early nations. These mascots in brass, made in
thousands to-day, are brass curios in the making;
possibly in a century or so they may be classed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the oldest brass amulets described in this chapter,
and so add to the metal relics to be collected by
future curio-hunters!</p>


<h3>Copper Sheathing and Nails.</h3>

<p>Copper sheathing has been used by boat-builders
and made to serve a useful purpose, protecting the
ship's bottom and resisting the action of salt water.
Oftentimes this valuable material&mdash;costly when new&mdash;has
been used over again when vessels have been
broken up, and not infrequently it is put to curious
uses in old seaport towns. Visitors to an old-world
village built on the side of a hill near the sea in
North Cornwall, have looked with admiration upon
two remarkable gateposts in front of a cottage
house, and admired their quaint carvings. These
relics in oak were once the ends of seats in a neighbouring
parish church; but either to preserve them
from injury from the village children or to give them
a longer life as they would be exposed to the
weather, the upper portions have been sheathed
with copper from the bottom of some broken-up
wreck, and large copper nails keep the casing in
place. Copper and brass nails have been used for
ornament as well as to resist acids and other metal-destroying
chemicals. Old furniture is evidence of
this; for at one time the leather covers to the chairs
were almost invariably fixed by round-headed brass
studs, which from that use became known in the
trade as "chair nails." Such nails were used to
ornament brass bellows and other domestic utensils.
They were also used to "decorate" the skin-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
trunks which our ancestors took with them on their
rare journeys of pleasure or business, when they
travelled by the mail-coach or less expensive stage
wagon. Nails of brass have been used and are still
sometimes used for sadder purposes, for they are
a feature in the ornament of cloth-covered coffins.
That of King Edward VI was decorated (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</i>) with
upwards of two thousand brass nails with gilt heads.</p>


<h3>War Relics.</h3>

<p>What wonderful antiquities are sometimes found
among scraps! Years of neglect cause indifference
to the contents of a scrapheap, and we read occasionally
of the dispersal of relics among which,
unknown to either sellers or buyers, there may be
antiquities of more than passing interest if their
original ownership could only be traced, for in the
personal relics of great warriors in our national
museums there clings a halo of hero-worship, and
what to many would be considered fictitious values
are attached to such curios. A few years ago the
relics from the battlefield of Waterloo, which had
for some time past been accumulated in a modest
looking building at the foot of the Lion Mound,
were dispersed. There were upwards of three
thousand pieces, including helmets of brass, plates
of shining metal, innumerable buttons and ornaments
belonging to different French regiments, including
officers' regimentals, and some relics of the British
and Prussian armies. In old curio-shops many
metal relics of battlefields are offered for sale, but
they have little or no interest to the buyer, simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
because their identity with their original owners has
been lost. It is of the greatest importance to future
generations of collectors that all records relating to
known curios should be chronicled, and that even
private collectors should hand on to their successors
adequate descriptions which may have been verbally
given them, so that private as well as national relics
may be identified and the monetary value in such
curios increased. Even a brass plate on an old gun,
bearing the name of a great man, makes it a relic
worth securing, whereas had the identity of ownership
been missing the weapon would be of little
or no value.</p>

<p>A visit to the United Service Museum at Westminster
is full of interest. There is an abundance
of personal relics there&mdash;not many of brass, it is
true&mdash;many of which are of special interest.
Perhaps the one of greatest historical fame is the
much battered copper bugle on which it is said the
signal was given for the fatal charge of the Light
Brigade at Balaclava, resulting so disastrously to
that famous regiment. There are some curious
trophies of brass, too, which have been brought home
by our troops; one known as "Jingling Johnny"
is of special interest.</p>


<h3>Tiny Curios.</h3>

<p>At one time there was quite a rage for miniatures
in metal-work. Artists in copper and brass vied
with one another in working microscopically. They
were very fond of making use of some recognized
piece of metal, the size, weight, and substance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
which was well understood by the public; hence
the difficulties of manipulating the works of art
they produced would be realized. Thus, out of a
copper farthing, a worker in metal would with very
tiny hammers and a still smaller soldering-iron and
miniature blow-pipe, fashion a complete copper teakettle
with a tiny spout out of which liquid could
be poured, a loose lid, a correctly formed knob, and
a beautifully shaped handle. Another would make
a similar kettle out of a similar piece of metal, and
leave some portion of the farthing, perhaps the date,
uninjured as the central ornament on the side of the
kettle, or on the top of the handle; others would add
a stand, like the then fashionable toddy-kettles and
stands. In a similar way other little domestic
utensils were made by the worker in copper, who
used watchmakers' hammers and tools such as
jewellers employed in the setting of precious stones.
A collector at one time had in his possession a
beautifully shaped coffee boiler of the type used
on the open fire when coffee was boiled and afterwards
allowed to stand on the hob for some time
before it was deemed sufficiently brewed. Another
charming miniature novelty was a brass stool, perforated,
and made to revolve just as the larger
toasting stool once common in every fireplace.
Fenders and fire-brasses were favourite objects for
miniature metal ornaments, and the way in which
the skilled worker manipulated the copper "sheets"
hammered out by hand from small coins showed
mastery of the craft and great patience. Such little
objects were frequently displayed on the "parlour"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
table under a glass shade, the woodworker being
sometimes requisitioned to make a stand, possibly
a canopied top, on which to show off to the best
advantage these tiny ornaments.</p>

<p>In the same way the engraver of brass and copper
worked under a strong lens, and sought to produce
whole texts of Scripture and quite long inscriptions
on an almost impossibly small surface. These little
pieces of metal were worn as charms, and similar
objects were displayed as trophies. Many of our
readers have seen no doubt the whole of the
Lord's Prayer or the Ten Commandments engraved
on a threepenny-piece or a copper farthing. It is
said such microscopic engraving took its rise in the
reign of Charles II when Thomas Simon, a noted
engraver of the Mint, engraved in double lines on his
famous "Petition Crown" a petition to the king.
Specimens of the crown are very rare, and are
regarded as the scarcest treasures in a numismatic
cabinet.</p>


<h3>Replicas.</h3>

<p>In conclusion, it may be pointed out that there is
no branch of curio collecting which has such a close
and intimate touch with modern art as that of copper
and brass. The tools with which the ancient coppersmiths
wrought and fashioned their most beautiful
works are still used by the coppersmiths of to-day,
for although in the eyes of some the traces of machine-stamped
or pressed ornament in the so-called reproductions
of the antiques are noticeable blemishes,
there are few distinguishing marks between the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and the new. Those modern artists who specialize
in providing those who furnish their houses in
antique style with replicas of the domestic copper-work
of a century or two ago, are very careful to
produce their "modern antique" by the use of tools
which produce precisely similar effects to the
hammered-by-hand copper-work of days gone by.
In the production of such work the repouss√© enrichments
are wrought by hand, the anvil still holding
sway in the modern coppersmith's shop. Rarely
is soldering used, the parts being riveted together.
In many cases although jardinieres and other vessels
have the appearance of being cast in a mould they
are really hollowed up under the rim by hammer and
block, and are without seam or joining. They are
fashioned exactly the same way as the beaten work
of old. Collectors may be warned against these
modern reproductions in that they should be careful
to pay a modern price for a modern antique.</p>

<p>The styles reproduced are chiefly those of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly
those of the Elizabethan and Cromwellian periods.
Thus electroliers are made to match antique furniture,
the difference being that instead of holding
electric bulbs the antique would have been fashioned
for candles or oil lamps. Many of the modern
reproductions of copper panels used for letting into
mantelpieces are designs, carefully copied, taken from
old baronial halls. The very grates of ormolu and
brass and the canopies of hammered copper and
brass are being made to-day by the same firms who
manufactured the metal-work designed by the Adam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
Brothers, and who in the eighteenth century had
already become famous as makers of coal stoves and
hob-grates. Then, again, in the utilitarian reproductions
of to-day there are the copper and brass fender
kerbs, reproducing the eighteenth-century fenders
without their bottom plates, and for use with them
the modern manufacturer makes fire-dogs and fire-brasses
of antique styles. Even the builder's brasswork
for ornamenting the interiors of houses, such as
finger-plates and door handles, are exact copies of the
old door-plates and lock-plates found on doors and
cupboards in existing houses built in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, and in their designs and
processes of manufacture it is difficult to distinguish
the genuine antique from the modern replica. Again,
the buyer of such things is warned against the unscrupulous
dealer who fills his windows with brass
and copper-work, almost hot from the Birmingham
foundry, and labels it "Antique." Not long ago
some of the shop windows were filled with chestnut
roasters in brass, with beautifully designed trivets,
with door knockers innumerable, and with even pipe-stoppers
and tobacco-boxes, all quite recently made
in the Black Country. Yet all these objects, sold as
modern by the honest dealer, have been and are
still not infrequently palmed off as antique, for they
have the finish which age in former years was wont
to impart, and in design and style they are correct
reproductions of the genuine antique.</p>

<p>The collection of metal has a peculiar charm, for
the objects are so numerous and the different alloys
produce such a pleasing variety of colour and appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
The value of such curios is now more fully
recognized than formerly, for greater prominence is
being given to them in museums, where in those
which have been re-arranged recently such objects
may be seen with labels on which their uses are fully
described and explained.</p>

<p>The collector has frequently to decide whether he
will entrust the repair of some much battered curio
to a local workman or undertake the r√¥le of an
amateur worker and repairer of copper or brass.
There are many who prefer the latter course; unless
the antique needs expert skill, and then, if a valuable
specimen, it should be sent to one whose professional
knowledge will enable him to carry out its restoration
without injury. There are, however, many minor
matters which, with a few simple tools, and recipes
which can be prepared quite easily, the collector can
very satisfactorily accomplish.</p>

<p>Before attempting to clean or repair old copper
and brass curios or those objects which are made all
or in part of either of them or of any of their alloys,
it is well to know something of the constituents of
the metals usually met with. First on the list comes
ancient bronzes composed mainly of copper and tin
on no accepted formula, but generally in the proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
of about three to one. Modern statuary bronze is
made in several proportions; one compound is given
by an authority as copper, 83 parts; tin, 5 parts; zinc,
10 parts; and lead, 2 parts; and by another as copper,
91 parts; tin, 9 parts. Bronze ornaments are mostly
copper, 80 parts; tin, 3 parts; zinc, 15 parts; and lead,
2 parts. Gongs are of copper, 80 parts; and tin, 20
parts&mdash;some Oriental alloys have a little silver added.
The ormolu of the brassfounder, used extensively by
French metal-workers, has more copper and less zinc
than brass. Red brass consists of copper, 25 parts;
zinc, 5 parts; and bismuth, 1 part. Yellow brass
is made of copper, 35 parts; and zinc, 15 parts.
Pinchbeck metal, of which watchcases and jewellery
have been made, consists of copper, 10 parts; and
of zinc, 2 parts. Antimony imparts a rich red to
copper.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the following paragraphs some very useful
"wrinkles" are given:</p>


<h3>Cleaning Copper and Brass.</h3>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to warn the collector against
over cleaning, for to rub light bronzes which age has
toned or encrusted with a beautiful patina would be
vandalism indeed. Yet there are many objects which
require attention when they arrive from the auction
mart or curio-shop. Ancient bronzes should be
washed in soap and water with soft brush or flannel&mdash;not
scrubbed&mdash;and then dried in hot sawdust.
If any polishing is necessary, a chamois leather
or an old silk handkerchief will be sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
The green patina or verdigris of antique metals
should <em>not</em> be removed nor its colouring spoiled with
cleaning.</p>

<p>Copper vessels, however, do very frequently require
cleaning. When they have turned a bluish green&mdash;not
the much admired patina&mdash;they may be cleaned
by making a paste of well powdered chalk and
methylated spirit. This preparation should be
rubbed on and then left until the spirit has evaporated
and the chalk is quite dry, at which stage it
can be removed and the copper polished with crocus
powder or fine chalk.</p>

<p>Owing to long neglect there are some metal curios
which cannot be thoroughly cleansed without a
powerful solvent. A weak solution of oxalic acid
may be safely applied with a piece of woollen
material; it will remove the tarnish, and then, after
well washing, the metal can be polished with fine
chalk or whiting. When the brass is spotted with
damp but not too deeply marked, chalk and spirits
of turpentine will generally effect the purpose just
as well.</p>

<p>Another recipe formerly much favoured by housewives
in the days when copper vessels were much in
evidence, is to rub them over with half a lemon
dipped in salt; then after washing polish with a
soft cloth. This is a useful recipe in that it does
not injure an antique appearance or patina, but it
will remove stains.</p>

<p>A somewhat more powerful preparation for metal-work
is a cleaning paste made as follows: oxalic
acid, 1 oz.; rotten stone, 6 oz; gum arabic, &frac12; oz.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
sweet oil, 1 oz.; and then add as much water as
necessary.</p>

<p>The following recipe is given for the benefit of
advanced collectors who wish to avail themselves
of modern methods. Such will no doubt delight
in experimenting on the cleansing of newly acquired
curios with a cleaning preparation operated by an
electric current. Caustic soda, &frac12; lb.; sal soda, &frac12; lb.;
resin, &frac14; oz.; and water, 1 gallon; 4 to 8 volts and
a current density of 12 amps. The greater the
density of the current the quicker the cleaning is
performed. A temperature of 120 Fahr. is recommended.</p>


<h3>Lacquering Metal.</h3>

<p>When it is desired to lacquer or coat over metal
to prevent any future oxidation (not commonly
desired by collectors of antiques) the copper or brass
article should be pickled for several hours in aqua
fortis diluted with water. The acid will rot away a
certain portion of the tarnished surface and leave
the metal bright. The article should then be put
into bran and well shaken until quite dry. It is
then ready to be cleaned, and, if desired, polished
bright.</p>

<p>Old brasswork may be relacquered by the amateur
with a little experience, practice, and care. First of
all it must be cleaned. The liquid which is best
suited to the purpose may be made of a strong lye
of wood ashes boiled and strengthened with soap
lees. This will fetch the old lacquer off. The article
should then be dipped in aqua fortis and water to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
take off the dirt, and immediately removed and
cleansed with clean water, and then when dried it
is ready to be lacquered. There are two processes
in simple lacquering, which may be defined as cold
and hot. The cold lacquer is the application of a
preparation of brass lacquer, which can be purchased
from any oil-shop, chemist, or metal dealer, put
on with a camelhair-brush like varnish, and immediately
placed in an oven or a hot stove, and exposed
to the heat for a few minutes until the lacquer is
quite firm and set. A gas-oven such as those in
common use in so many kitchens nowadays answers
the purpose very well.</p>

<p>The second method is the application of lacquer
after the article has been heated. The heating may
be done in a gas-oven, or by the application of a
flat-iron such as is used by laundresses. Then
lacquer should be applied hot, and if the object
lacquered has cooled in the process heat should again
be applied as in the first process. It should be
clearly understood that cleaning and relacquering
old brass and copper-work should be done with very
great care and with a full appreciation of the curio
value of old finish, and of the marks and evidences
of age which are so dear to the collector. The
pickling of brasswork in acid and subsequent
lacquering should only be resorted to when it is
absolutely necessary to effect such restoration, and
to make the objects sufficiently presentable so that
they may be included in a cabinet or exhibited in
the collection of metal curios; for the possession of
old copper and brass is nothing without the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
of showing it. There are some specialists who
devote their attention to the restoration and bronzing
of medi√¶val and early ecclesiastical work. It may
on occasion be necessary to consult such a firm
before attempting anything which would savour of
vandalism and rob the present-day possessor and
curio-hunter of the future of what might eventually
become a rare antiquity.</p>


<h3>Polishing Brass.</h3>

<p>It may at times be necessary to polish parts of
curios which have been subjected to rough wear and
are, therefore, badly scratched. A very fine file will
remove scratches; fine emery will then make the
surface quite smooth, after which it can be polished
with rotten stone and oil, some adding a little
turpentine.</p>


<h3>Restoring Antique Finishes.</h3>

<p>There are many beautiful antiques which have
been subjected to rough usage or through some
accident have had the oxidation rubbed off in parts.
To clean such an antique so as to secure uniformity
of appearance would be a mistake. It is better to
"restore" the finish and imitate that which age
has imparted. The solution required is 60 gr. nitrate
of silver and 2&frac12; oz. water, mixed with a solution of
60 gr. nitrate of copper and 2&frac12; oz. water. After the
solution has been applied to the parts the object
should be heated in a gas-oven until it is sufficiently
dark coloured.</p>

<p>Some time ago an expert in Indian antiques,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
bronzes, and metal-work published in <cite>The Times of
India</cite> an account of how Oriental bronze and brass
which had been soiled and scratched by time and
climatic conditions might be restored. The writer
went on to describe how the great secret of restoring
the dull half-green and half-brown shades had been
revealed to him. The remedy he propounded was
simple in the extreme. It was that the statue should
be washed in beer, which should not be rubbed off
but allowed to dry on.</p>


<h3>Using the Burnisher.</h3>

<p>The amateur restorer may frequently with advantage
acquire a knowledge of the burnisher, and
thereby add much to the beauty of the metal.
Those who have watched an old coppersmith planishing
copper-work, and have noticed the very primitive
materials used, will have learnt to realize the value
of "elbow grease." Crocus powder with oil and
soft rags works wonders, and will often bring up
the original finish just as the coppersmith converts
the rough dull polish of the metal sheets he has
fashioned into domestic copper ware and shining
pots and pans.</p>


<h3>Brass Rubbings.</h3>

<p>Rubbings of church and memorial brasses referred
to in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a> may be taken with heel-ball,
which is a compound of beeswax, and plain white
paper. When the brass has been evenly rubbed all
over the picture is complete and ready for mounting.
It should then be cut out and pasted on a prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
surface of fine canvas or calico, thus giving the
rubbing an appearance like tapestry. It can be
touched up in colours, if there is any heraldic
enamelled work on the original. It can then be
sized and stretched on a frame ready for hanging
on a wall.</p>
